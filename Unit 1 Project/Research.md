Gestalt psychology gives some explanations as to how simple objects group together to form perceptual objects. The Gestalt rules that describe these groupings can also be applied to the perception of sound. Hence, it should be possible to achieve a level of resemblance between an image and its sonification by taking care to conserve the perceptual relationships between the visual features when translating them to sound.
