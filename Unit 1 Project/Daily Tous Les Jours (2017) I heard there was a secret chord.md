#### *I Heard There Was a Secret Chord*

#### Intro

At any given moment, hundreds of people are listening to Leonard Cohenâ€™s *Hallelujah* at the same time. *I Heard There Was a Secret Chord* creates a metaphysical connection between them through a sensory experience, in an attempt to demystify this universal hymn.

#### Sensory Connections 

Singing in a group brings about visceral universal emotions, humming, on the other hand, creates a musical vibration inside the body. *I Heard There Was a Secret Chord* merges the two sensations and provides the public a moment of communal contemplation on the universal, quasi-mystical quality of *Hallelujah*.
