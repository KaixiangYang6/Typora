p73 How should We treat Nature?

For the most part, contemporary environmental philosophy has been "environmental ethics," Environmental ethics focuses on questions about how humans ought to treat nonhuman nature: for example, What is the nature of our responsibilny to the natural environment? When and why are we obligated to preserve wilderness areas, protect endangered species. engage in sustainable development and appropriate technology? Are some theoretical approaches to resolving envionmental problems more fruitful than others?

在大多数情况下，当代环境哲学一直是 "环境伦理学"，环境伦理学的重点是关于人类应该如何对待非人类自然的问题：例如，我们对自然环境的责任的本质是什么？我们何时以及为何有义务保护荒野地区、保护濒危物种、参与可持续发展和适当技术？解决环境问题的一些理论方法是否比其他方法更有成效？

There are two primary goals of this chapter: to introduce the reader to the field of environmental ethics, and to situate the version of ecofeminist philosophy Iam defending within environmental ethics. Ibegin with a brief discussion of the concep: nf "moral considerability." Ithen provide an overview of the variety of theones III environmental ethics, followed by a sketch of some ecofeminist philosophical worries about key assumptions underlying many of these theories. I end with a discussion of ways in which my version of ecoferninist philosophy does and does not fit into the spectrum of theories in environmental ethics. Iconclude that anecofeminist philosophical perspective is not only a distinctive but a transformative perspective on human-nature relationships.

本章有两个主要目标：向读者介绍环境伦理学领域，并将我所捍卫的生态女性主义哲学的版本置于环境伦理学中。我首先简要讨论了 "道德可考虑性 "的概念。然后概述了环境伦理学的各种理论，接着概述了一些生态女性主义哲学对这些理论中的关键假设的担忧。最后，我讨论了我的生态女性主义哲学与环境伦理学的理论谱系的契合与不契合之处。我的结论是，生态女性主义哲学观点不仅是一个独特的，而且是一个关于人类与自然关系的变革性观点。

Environmental ethicists distinguish between an ethic of the environment and an ethic concerning the environment. An ethic of the environment asserts that the nonhuman natural environment itself (and /or its nonhuman members) is deserving of moral consideration ("morally considerable"), An ethic concerning the environment denies that the nonhuman environment itself (and/or its nonhuman members) is morally considerable, although there are constraints (moral and other) on how humans may treat the environment. Only an ethic afthe environment generates a bona fide environmental ethic.

环境伦理学家区分了环境伦理和关于环境的伦理。环境伦理学主张非人类自然环境本身（和/或其非人类成员）值得道德上的考虑（"道德上的重要性"），关于环境的伦理学否认非人类环境本身（和/或其非人类成员）在道德上的重要性，尽管在人类如何对待环境方面存在着限制（道德和其他）。只有环境后的伦理才会产生真正的环境伦理。

Notice that the distinction between an ethic of and an ethic concerning the natural environment turns on the notion of "moral considerability." It is a basic assumption of environmental ethics that nonhuman animals and/or nature are "morally considerable"; that is they deserve moral consideration by humans, Commitment to the moral considerability of nonhuman animals and/or nature i, what makes an environmental ethic an environmental ethic.

请注意，关于自然环境的伦理和关于自然环境的伦理之间的区别取决于 "道德上的可考虑性 "这一概念。环境伦理学的一个基本假设是，非人类动物和/或自然是 "道德上可考虑的"；也就是说，它们值得人类给予道德上的考虑，对非人类动物和/或自然的道德可考虑性的承诺，是环境伦理学成为环境伦理学的原因。

Nonetheless, there is considerable disagreement and, I think, confusion among environmental ethicists about both the basis of moral considerability and howto prove that nonhuman nature is morally considerable, Typically, one of two related strategiesis offered to prove the moral considerability of "nature."

然而，环境伦理学家对道德可考虑性的基础以及如何证明非人类自然在道德上是可考虑的，存在着相当大的分歧，我认为是混乱的。

The first strategy is to argue that what makes "nature" morally considerable is that nature has certain properties that make it morally considerable-prope~ies that are shared by all and only morally considerable entities, The properties com mon,lyargued for indude: rationality, sentiency, the ability to use a language, pos sess~,on of a soul, possession of morally relevant interests, being "the subject ofa life, and Simply being alive, When asked why any of these properties is suffi· cient to establish moral considerability, the answer often reduces to the claim thai these properties are those On which moral considerability rests.

第一种策略是论证使 "自然界 "具有道德意义的原因是，自然界具有使其具有道德意义的某些属性--这些属性是所有且仅有的具有道德意义的实体所共有的，所论证的属性包括。当被问及为什么这些属性中的任何一个都足以确立道德上的可考虑性时，答案往往简化为声称这些属性是道德上可考虑性所依赖的。
