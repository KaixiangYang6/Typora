It is usually at the edges where the great tectonic plates of theory meet and shift that we find the most dramatic developments and upheavals. When four tectonic plates of liberation theory—those concerned with the oppressions of gender, race, class and nature—finally come together, the resulting tremors could shake the conceptual structures of oppression to their foundations. Feminism has undergone major conflict, transformation and enrichment as a result of its encounters with other forms of domination and their theories, especially those of race and class. **A feminist account of the domination of nature presents an essential but difficult further frontier for feminist theory, all the more testing and controversial because the problematic of nature has been so closely interwoven with that of gender. Because ‘nature’ has been a very broad and shifting category and has encompassed many different sorts of colonisation, an adequate account of the domination of nature must draw widely on accounts of other forms of oppression, and has an important integrating role.** 

<u>**Ecofeminism has contributed a great deal both to activist struggle and to theorising links between women’s oppression and the domination of nature over the last two decades. In some versions it has engaged with all four forms of exploitation encompassed in race, class, gender and nature.**</u> At the same time, ecofeminism has been stereotyped in some quarters both as theoretically weak and as doubtfully liberated, and also as exclusively linked to what is often now termed cultural feminism. My objective in this book is to help develop an environmental feminism that can be termed a critical ecological feminism, one which is thoroughly compatible with and can be strongly based in feminist theory.

通常在理论的巨大构造板块相遇和转移的边缘，我们会发现最戏剧性的发展和动荡。当解放理论的四个板块--那些与性别、种族、阶级和自然的压迫有关的板块--最终聚集在一起时，所产生的震荡可能会把压迫的概念结构摇到其基础上。女权主义经历了重大的冲突、转变和丰富，因为它与其他形式的统治及其理论，特别是与种族和阶级的理论相遇。女权主义对自然统治的解释为女权主义理论提供了一个重要但困难的进一步前沿，由于自然问题与性别问题如此紧密地交织在一起，所以更加具有考验性和争议性。**由于 "自然 "是一个非常广泛和变化的类别，并且包括许多不同种类的殖民化，对自然的统治的充分说明必须广泛借鉴对其他形式的压迫的说明，并且具有重要的整合作用。**在过去的二十年里，生态女性主义对活动家的斗争以及对妇女受压迫和自然统治之间的联系的理论化作出了很大的贡献。在某些版本中，它涉及到种族、阶级、性别和自然中所包含的所有四种剥削形式。同时，生态女权主义在某些方面被定型为理论上的弱点，被认为是可疑的解放，也被认为完全与现在经常被称为文化女权主义的东西相联系。我在这本书中的目标是帮助发展一种环境女权主义，它可以被称为批判性的生态女权主义，它与女权主义理论完全兼容，并可以牢固地建立在女权主义理论之上。

A better theory can, I believe, greatly increase the critical and analytical force of ecological feminism and make it a far more powerful political tool. It can provide a basis for a connected and co-operative political practice for liberation movements. We need a common, integrated framework for the critique of both human domination and the domination of nature—integrating nature as a fourth category of analysis into the framework of an extended feminist theory which employs a race, class and gender analysis. I try to show the importance of nature as the missing piece in this framework, and its vital contribution to a more complete understanding of domination and colonisation.

我相信，一个更好的理论可以大大增加生态女权主义的批判和分析力量，使其成为一个更强大的政治工具。它可以为解放运动提供一个连接和合作的政治实践的基础。我们需要一个共同的、综合的框架来批判人类的统治和对自然的统治--将自然作为第四类分析纳入采用种族、阶级和性别分析的扩展的女权主义理论框架。我试图说明自然作为这个框架中缺失的部分的重要性，以及它对更完整地理解统治和殖民化的重要贡献。

A further major aim of the book is to provide a thorough grounding for a feminist environmental philosophy. The book engages with the heavily masculine presence which has inhabited most accounts of environmental philosophy, including those of many deep ecologists. Their accounts, I show, often retain a dualistic dynamic, although frequently this has appeared in subtle ways and in unlikely guises. I show how a different and improved basis for environmental politics and philosophy might be constructed by taking better account of the ethics and politics of mutuality as developed by a number of feminist thinkers. On this basis, I try to show how the treatment of nature can be thought of in political terms as well as ethical terms. It is here especially that male theorists (for example, Chase 1991) have typically overlooked feminist thought and the contribution the ‘third position’ of ecofeminist theory can make to a resolution of the problems behind the bitter ‘ecopolitics debate’ between ‘deep ecologists’ and ‘social ecologists’, problems which continue to preoccupy and divide the green movement.

本书的另一个主要目的是为女性主义环境哲学提供一个彻底的基础。本书与居住在大多数环境哲学论述中的严重男性化的存在进行了探讨，包括那些许多深层生态学家的论述。我表明，他们的论述经常保留着二元论的动态，尽管这经常以微妙的方式和不可能的伪装出现。我表明，通过更好地考虑一些女权主义思想家所发展的相互性的伦理和政治，可以为环境政治和哲学构建一个不同的和改进的基础。在此基础上，我试图说明如何从政治和伦理的角度来考虑对待自然的问题。特别是在这里，男性理论家（例如，Chase 1991）通常忽视了女权主义思想和生态女权主义理论的 "第三立场 "对解决 "深层生态学家 "和 "社会生态学家 "之间激烈的 "生态政治学辩论 "背后的问题的贡献，这些问题继续困扰着绿色运动并造成分裂。

Forms of oppression from both the present and the past have left their traces in western culture as a network of dualisms, and the logical structure of dualism forms a major basis for the connection between forms of oppression. The second chapter of this book begins to develop a new analysis of dualism which explicates the concept carefully in logical terms and shows what can be made good in it. The implications of this analysis are pursued throughout the remaining chapters. The concept of dualism has been crucial to much philosophical and feminist thought, yet is usually only vaguely articulated. My argument examines this concept in a more connected, complete and rigorous way than heretofore, and presses home the political and cultural critique it underpins. <u>**I argue that western culture has treated the human/nature relation as a dualism and that this explains many of the problematic features of the west’s treatment of nature which underlie the environmental crisis, especially the western construction of human identity as ‘outside’ nature.**</u> A detailed analysis of dualism also shows that its characteristic logical structure of otherness and negation corresponds closely to classical prepositional logic, the leading logical theory of modernity. I argue that classical logic, as the logic of instrumental reason, approximates this structure, and that is a major reason why it has been selected out of alternative theoretical possibilities. Moreover, the logic of dualism yields a common conceptual framework which structures otherwise different categories of oppression.

现在和过去的压迫形式都在西方文化中留下了它们作为二元论网络的痕迹，二元论的逻辑结构构成了压迫形式之间联系的主要基础。**本书的第二章开始对二元论进行新的分析，从逻辑上仔细阐释了这个概念，并说明在其中可以有什么好处。这一分析的意义将在其余各章中进行探讨。二元论的概念对许多哲学和女权主义思想至关重要，但通常只是被模糊地阐述。我的论点以一种比以往更有联系、更完整和更严格的方式来审视这个概念，并将它所支撑的政治和文化批判压在了心里。我认为，西方文化将人与自然的关系视为二元论，这解释了西方对待自然的许多问题，这些问题是环境危机的基础，特别是西方将人类身份构建为 "自然之外"。**对二元论的详细分析还表明，其特有的他者和否定的逻辑结构与现代性的主要逻辑理论--古典介词逻辑密切对应。我认为，古典逻辑作为工具理性的逻辑，接近于这种结构，这也是它在其他理论可能性中被选中的主要原因。此外，二元论的逻辑产生了一个共同的概念框架，它结构了其他不同类别的压迫。

In feminist and liberation theory, the misty, forbidding passes of the Mountains of Dualism have swallowed many an unwary traveller in their mazes and chasms. In these mountains, a well-trodden path leads through a steep defile to the Cavern of Reversal, where travellers fall into an upside-down world which strangely resembles the one they seek to escape. Trapped Romantics wander here, lamenting their exile, as do various tribes of Arcadians, Earth Mothers, Noble Savages and Working-Class Heroes whose identities are defined by reversing the valuations of the dominant culture. Postmodernist thinkers have found a way to avoid this cavern, and have erected a sign pointing out the danger, but have not yet discovered another path across the mountains to the promised land of liberatory politics on the other side. Mostly they linger by the Well of Discourse near the cavern, gazing in dismay into the fearful and bottomless Abyss of Relativism beyond it. The path to the promised land of reflective practice passes over the Swamp of Affirmation, which careful and critical travellers, picking their way through, can with some difficulty cross. Intrepid travellers who have found their way across the Swamp of Affirmation into the lands beyond often either fall into the Ocean of Continuity on the one side or stray into the waterless and alien Desert of Difference on the other, there to perish. The pilgrim’s path to the promised land leads along a narrow way between these two hazards, and involves heeding both difference and continuity.

在女权主义和解放理论中，二元论之山虚无缥缈、令人望而却步的通道，将许多不怀好意的旅行者吞没在它们的迷宫和鸿沟中。在这些山脉中，有一条熟悉的小路穿过陡峭的隘口，通向逆转之洞，旅行者在那里跌入一个颠倒的世界，与他们想要逃离的世界奇特地相似。被困的浪漫主义者在这里徘徊，哀叹他们的流亡，就像阿卡迪亚人、地球母亲、高贵的野蛮人和工人阶级英雄等各种部落一样，他们的身份是通过颠覆主流文化的价值来定义的。后现代主义思想家们已经找到了避开这个洞穴的方法，并竖起了一个标志，指出了危险，但还没有发现另一条穿过山脉的道路，通往另一边的自由政治的应许之地。他们大多在洞穴附近的话语之井旁徘徊，惊愕地注视着井外可怕的、无底的相对主义深渊。通往反思性实践的应许之地的道路要经过肯定的沼泽地，小心谨慎的旅行者，挑剔地穿过沼泽地，会有一些困难。无畏的旅行者找到了穿越 "肯定之沼 "的道路，进入了更远的地方，但他们往往不是掉进一边的 "连续之海"，就是误入另一边的无水的、陌生的 "差异之漠"，在那里灭亡。朝圣者通往应许之地的道路是在这两种危险之间的一条狭窄的道路，并涉及到对差异和连续性的关注。

Dualism has formed the modern political landscape of the west as much as the ancient one. In this landscape, nature must be seen as a political  rather than a descriptive category, a sphere formed from the multiple exclusions of the protagonist-superhero of the western psyche, reason, whose adventures and encounters form the stuff of western intellectual history. The concept of reason provides the unifying and defining contrast for the concept of nature, much as the concept of husband does for that of wife, as master for slave. Reason in the western tradition has been constructed as the privileged domain of the master, who has conceived nature as a wife or subordinate other encompassing and representing the sphere of materiality, subsistence and the feminine which the master has split off and constructed as beneath him. The continual and cumulative overcoming of the domain of nature by reason engenders the western concept of progress and development. But as in other patriarchal reproductive contexts, it is the father who takes credit for and possession of this misbegotten child, and who guides its subsequent development in ways which continue to deny and devalue the maternal role.

二元论和古代一样，形成了西方的现代政治景观。在这一景观中，自然必须被视为一个政治性而非描述性的范畴，一个由西方心理的主角--超级英雄--理性的多重排斥所形成的领域，其冒险和遭遇构成了西方思想史的内容。理性的概念为自然的概念提供了统一的、决定性的对比，就像丈夫的概念对妻子的概念一样，就像主人对奴隶那样。理性在西方传统中被建构为主人的特权领域，主人将自然界视为妻子或从属的他者，包括并代表物质性、生存和女性的领域，主人将其分割并建构为在其之下。理性对自然领域的持续和累积的克服产生了西方的进步和发展概念。但就像在其他父权制的生殖环境中一样，是父亲为这个被遗弃的孩子邀功和占有，并以继续否认和贬低母亲角色的方式指导其后续发展。

The account I develop here links environmental philosophy strongly to the important contemporary critique of reason and of rationalist philosophy, which has emerged especially from feminist and some postmodernist philosophy. Since defenders of the western tradition (and even some nervous old guard critics of it) persistently and vociferously portray criticism of the dominant forms of reason as the rejection of all reason and the embrace of irrationality, it is still necessary to stress that critiquing the dominant forms of reason which embody the master identity and oppose themselves to the sphere of nature does not imply abandoning all forms of reason, science and individuality. Rather, it involves their redefinition or reconstruction in less oppositional and hierarchical ways. To uncover the political identity behind these dominant forms of reason is not to decrease, but rather greatly to increase, the scope and power of political analysis.

我在这里展开的叙述将环境哲学与当代对理性和理性主义哲学的重要批判紧密联系起来，这种批判特别是从女权主义和一些后现代主义哲学中产生的。由于西方传统的捍卫者（甚至是一些紧张的守旧派批评者）坚持不懈地大声疾呼，将对理性的主导形式的批评描绘成对所有理性的拒绝和对非理性的拥抱，因此仍然有必要强调，对体现主人身份并将自己与自然领域相对立的理性的主导形式的批评，并不意味着放弃所有形式的理性、科学和个性。相反，它涉及到以较少的对抗性和等级性的方式重新定义或重建它们。揭示这些主导理性形式背后的政治身份，并不是要减少，而是要大大增加政治分析的范围和力量。

Thus it is also exclusion from the master category of reason which in liberation struggles provides and explains the conceptual links between different categories of domination, and links the domination of humans to the domination of nature. The category of nature is a field of multiple exclusion and control, not only of non-humans, but of various groups of humans and aspects of human life which are cast as nature. Thus racism, colonialism and sexism have drawn their conceptual strength from casting sexual, racial and ethnic difference as closer to the animal and the body construed as a sphere of inferiority, as a lesser form of humanity lacking the full measure of rationality or culture. As Vandana Shiva points out (1989, 1991), it is not only women’s labour which traditionally gets subsumed ‘by definition’ into nature, but the labour of colonised non-western, non-white people also. The connections between these forms of domination in the west are thus partly the result of chance and of specific historical evolution, and partly formed from a necessity inherent in the dynamic and logic of domination between self and other, reason and nature.

因此，在解放斗争中，也是对理性这一主范畴的排斥，它提供并解释了不同统治范畴之间的概念联系，并将对人类的统治与对自然的统治联系起来。自然范畴是一个多重排斥和控制的领域，不仅是对非人类的排斥和控制，而且是对各种人类群体和人类生活的各个方面的排斥和控制，这些都被铸成了自然。因此，种族主义、殖民主义和性别主义从将性、种族和民族差异视为更接近于动物和身体的概念力量，将其视为低劣的领域，视为缺乏理性或文化的充分措施的较低形式的人类。**正如Vandana Shiva所指出的（1989年，1991年），不仅妇女的劳动在传统上被 "定义 "为自然，而且被殖民的非西方人、非白人的劳动也被归入自然。因此，西方的这些统治形式之间的联系，部分是偶然和特定历史演变的结果，部分是由自我和他人、理性和自然之间的统治动态和逻辑中固有的必要性形成的。**

To be defined as ‘nature’ in this context is to be defined as passive, as non-agent and non-subject, as the ‘environment’ or invisible background conditions against which the ‘foreground’ achievements of reason or culture (provided typically by the white, western, male expert or entrepreneur) take place. It is to be defined as a terra nullius,  a resource empty of its own purposes or meanings, and hence available to be annexed for the purposes of those supposedly identified with reason or intellect, and to be conceived and moulded in relation to these purposes. It means being seen as part of a sharply separate, even alien lower realm, whose domination is simply ‘natural’, flowing from nature itself and the nature(s) of things. Such treatment, standard in the west for nature since at least the Enlightenment, has since that time been opposed and officially condemned for humans (while all the while normalised for marginalised groups such as women and the colonised). Western culture is only just coming to realise that the same construction might also be problematic for non-human nature.

**在这种情况下，被定义为 "自然 "就是被定义为被动的、非代理人和非主体的、作为 "环境 "或无形的背景条件，而理性或文化的 "前景 "成就（通常由白人、西方、男性专家或企业家提供）是在这种背景下发生的。它被定义为一个无主之地，一个没有自己的目的或意义的资源，因此可以为那些被认为是理性或智力的人的目的所吞并，并根据这些目的而被构想和塑造。这意味着被看作是一个截然分开的、甚至是异己的低级领域的一部分，它的统治仅仅是 "自然的"，来自于自然本身和事物的本质（）。在西方，至少从启蒙运动开始，这种对待自然的方式就是标准的，从那时起，人类就被反对和正式谴责了（而对妇女和被殖民者等边缘化群体来说则是正常的）。西方文化只是刚刚意识到，同样的构造对非人类自然也可能是有问题的。**

Much feminist theory has detected a masculine presence in the officially gender-neutral concept of reason. In contrast, my account suggests that it is not a masculine identity pure and simple, but the multiple, complex cultural identity of the master formed in the context of class, race species and gender domination, which is at issue. This cultural identity has framed the dominant concepts of western thought, especially those of reason and nature. The recognition of a more complex dominator identity is, I would argue, essential if feminism is not to repeat the mistakes of a reductionist programme such as Marxism, which treats one form of domination as central and aims to reduce all others to subsidiary forms of it which will ‘wither away’ once the ‘fundamental’ form is overcome. It is necessary also if we are to give proper emphasis to the role of culture and uncover the deep structures of oppression in culture which help account for the persistence of domination through political and economic change.

**许多女性主义理论在官方的性别中立的理性概念中发现了男性的存在。与此相反，我的论述表明，问题不在于纯粹的男性身份，而在于在阶级、种族和性别统治的背景下形成的主人的多重、复杂的文化身份。这种文化身份框定了西方思想的主导概念，特别是那些理性和自然的概念。**我认为，如果女权主义不想重蹈马克思主义等还原主义方案的覆辙，承认更复杂的主宰者身份是至关重要的，因为马克思主义把一种形式的主宰视为核心，旨在把所有其他形式的主宰还原为附属形式，一旦 "基本 "形式被克服，就会 "枯萎"。如果我们要适当地强调文化的作用，揭示文化中的深层压迫结构，这也是必要的，这有助于解释统治在政治和经济变革中的持续存在。

The first chapter of this book outlines the relations between feminism and ecological feminism, while the second establishes a basis for my analysis of dualism. I support my account of the role and formation of reason/nature dualism in terms of the master identity by a reexamination of the western rationalist tradition and of the exclusions present in the Platonic account of reason (chapter 3). I argue that many elements of Platonic reason/nature dualism remain unresolved in modern approaches to reason, human identity and death. This analysis of the philosophical past throws into the foreground the many conflicts and tensions in feminist, ecophilosophical and ecofeminist historical accounts of the origins of the domination of nature and of women, especially those which locate the entire problem in the Enlightenment and the rise of atomistic science.

本书的第一章概述了女性主义和生态女性主义之间的关系，而第二章则为我分析二元论奠定了基础。**我通过重新审视西方理性主义传统和柏拉图式的理性论述中存在的排斥现象，来支持我对理性/自然二元论在主人身份方面的作用和形成的阐述（第三章）。我认为，柏拉图式的理性/自然二元论的许多要素在现代理性、人类身份和死亡的方法中仍然没有得到解决。**这种对哲学历史的分析将女权主义、生态哲学和生态女权主义对支配自然和妇女的起源的历史叙述中的许多冲突和紧张抛到了前台，特别是那些将整个问题定位在启蒙运动和原子论科学的崛起中的叙述。

These accounts are commonly supplemented in green thought by an account of mechanism which equates it with atomism. My account presented in chapters 4 and 5 upsets some of this conventional wisdom in green thought on mechanism by focusing on dualism rather than atomism. Breaking the dualism involves both affirming and reconceptualising the underside, nature. Cartesian thought has stripped nature of the intentional and mindlike qualities which make an ethical response to it possible. Once nature is reconceived as capable of agency and intentionality, and human identity is reconceived in less polarised and disembodied ways, the great gulf which Cartesian thought established between the conscious, mindful human sphere and the mindless, clockwork natural one disappears. This approach means that my account leans less heavily on the saving grace of ‘new’ science than does the conventional account, and does not rely so much on the rather overworked holistic paradigm, which is of course also enormously problematic as a political framework.

在绿色思想中，这些说法通常以一种将机制等同于原子主义的说法作为补充。我在第4章和第5章中的论述通过关注二元论而非原子论，颠覆了绿色思想中关于机制的一些传统智慧。**打破二元论包括肯定和重新认识自然的底层。笛卡尔思想剥夺了自然的意向性和思想性，而这种意向性和思想性使得对自然的伦理反应成为可能。一旦自然被重新认识为具有代理权和意向性，而人类的身份也被重新认识为不那么两极化和非实体化，那么笛卡尔思想在有意识、有思想的人类领域和无意识、发条式的自然领域之间建立的巨大鸿沟就会消失。**这种方法意味着我的论述比传统的论述更少地依赖于 "新 "科学的拯救之恩，也不那么依赖被过度使用的整体范式，当然，这种范式作为一个政治框架也有很大的问题。

Later sections of the book carry the analysis of reason/nature dualism and its impact on human relations to nature into the further areas of self/ other, public/private and reason/emotion dualism (chapter 6). I also show how a dualised conception of self and other, reason and emotion, universal and particular, underlies the instrumental treatment of nature and its exclusion from ethical significance in western (now global) culture, and how a dualist dynamic is often retained in positions such as deep ecology which claim to have escaped it (chapter 7). Overcoming the dualistic dynamic requires recognition of both continuity and difference; this means acknowledging the other as neither alien to and discontinuous from self nor assimilated to or an extension of self. I relate this account to contemporary political theory, with its dominant problematic of selfhood and rationality.

本书后面的章节将理性/自然二元论的分析及其对人类与自然关系的影响带入自我/他者、公共/私人和理性/情感二元论的进一步领域（第六章）。我还展示了自我与他人、理性与情感、普遍与特殊的二元化概念是如何在西方（现在是全球）文化中对自然进行工具性处理并将其排除在伦理意义之外的，以及二元化动态是如何在诸如深度生态学等声称已经摆脱它的立场中经常被保留的（第七章）。克服二元论的动态需要承认连续性和差异性；这意味着承认他人既不是与自我相异和不连续的，也不是被自我同化或延伸的。我将这一说法与当代政治理论联系起来，其主要问题是自我性和理性。

In this period of crisis, time taken for the development of theory seems a luxury indeed. But if we do not understand the development and the defects in the western story of reason and nature, we may remain trapped within it or settle for one of its new versions. The contemporary human and environmental crisis underlines the cultural centrality of the reason/nature story, and the urgency of resolving the western network of dualisms. Much modern environmental wisdom from such thinkers as David Suzuki has as its main theme the message that humans are animals and have the same dependence on a healthy biosphere as other forms of life. On the surface, it is puzzling that an apparent truism should find so much resistance and should need to be stressed so much. But the reason why this message of continuity and dependency is so revolutionary in the context of the modern world is that the dominant strands of western culture have for so long denied it, and have given us a model of human identity as only minimally and accidentally connected to the earth.

在这个危机时期，为发展理论所花的时间似乎确实是一种奢侈。但如果我们不了解西方理性与自然的故事的发展和缺陷，我们可能会继续被困在其中，或者满足于其中的一个新版本。**当代的人类和环境危机强调了理性/自然故事的文化中心地位，以及解决西方二元论网络的紧迫性。**许多来自**大卫-铃木等思想家的现代环境智慧的主旨是：人类是动物，与其他形式的生命一样，对健康的生物圈有着同样的依赖。从表面上看，令人费解的是，一个明显的不言而喻的道理竟然会遇到如此多的阻力，而且还需要如此强调。但是，在现代世界的背景下，这种连续性和依赖性的信息之所以如此具有革命性，是因为西方文化的主导阶层长期以来一直否认它，并给我们提供了一个人类身份的模型，即与地球只有最低限度的、偶然的联系。**

For all the formal knowledge of evolutionary biology, this model of disconnection remains deeply and fatally entrenched in modern conceptions of the human and of nature, inscribed in culture as a result of a dynamic which sought to naturalise domination in both human and non-human spheres. We must find ways to rework our concepts and practices of human virtue and identity as they have been conceived, since at least the time of the Greeks, as exclusive of and discontinuous with the devalued orders of the feminine, of subsistence, of materiality and of non-human nature. The master culture must now make its long-overdue homecoming to the earth. This is no longer simply a matter of justice, but now also a matter of survival.

就进化生物学的所有正式知识而言，这种断绝关系的模式仍然深深地、致命地扎根于现代人类和自然的概念中，它被刻在文化中，是一种试图将人类和非人类领域的统治自然化的动力的结果。我们必须找到方法来重塑我们关于人类美德和身份的概念和实践，因为至少从希腊人的时代开始，它们就被认为是与女性、生存、物质和非人类自然的贬值秩序相排斥和不相干的。主文化现在必须使其早该回到地球上了。这不再仅仅是一个正义的问题，现在也是一个生存的问题。



p190 Conclusion

The account I have given replaces phallocentrism as the chief concept of cultural analysis by the identity—at once more specific and more universal—of the master subject who has held and shaped most of the high ground of western culture, especially that delineated as the territory of reason. It is not material conditions—nature as stingy mother—which have kept us everywhere in chains, as Marxist fundamentalism would have us believe, but our own cultural bondage to the logic of the master. Since culture was shaped around the written word in Plato’s time, the ruling elites (whose identities are condensed in the master subject) which stand at the apex of various forms of domination have been able through their command of social resources to exercise control over culture disproportionate to their numbers. They have made much of it as their instrument and in their image. Their hegemony has created deep structures in culture which ensure the continuation and expansion of oppression through many political changes. Mainly by means of the deep structures of dualism, even the challenges to the ruling elites have been appropriated by the master forms of consciousness or remade in their terms. Although the superrich increasingly own both the world and the word, the master identity is more than a conspiracy: it is a legacy, a form of culture, a form of rationality, a framework for selfhood and relationship which, through this appropriation of culture, has come to shape us all.

我给出的说明取代了作为文化分析的主要概念的菲勒斯中心主义，即更具体和更普遍的主宰主体的身份，他掌握并塑造了西方文化的大部分高地，尤其是被划定为理性的领地。不是物质条件--作为吝啬的母亲的自然--让我们到处被锁住，就像马克思主义原教旨主义要我们相信的那样，而是我们自己的文化对主人的逻辑的束缚。自从文化在柏拉图时代围绕书面文字形成以来，站在各种统治形式顶点的统治精英（他们的身份浓缩在主宰主体中）就能够通过他们对社会资源的控制，对文化实施与其人数不相称的控制。他们将文化作为自己的工具，并以自己的形象加以利用。他们的霸权在文化中创造了深层结构，通过许多政治变革确保压迫的持续和扩张。主要是通过二元论的深层结构，即使是对统治精英的挑战也被意识的主宰形式所占有，或者按照他们的条件重新制作。尽管超级富豪越来越多地拥有世界和话语权，但主人身份不仅仅是一个阴谋：它是一种遗产，一种文化形式，一种理性形式，一种自我身份和关系的框架，通过这种对文化的占有，它已经开始塑造我们所有人。

As we have seen, the deep structures of mastery are buried in the foundations of western intellectual frameworks and conceptual history. There is scarcely a subject or a topic which is not entwined in the knots of dualism these conceptual structures have created. The master’s logic of colonisation is the dominant logic of our time. The explanation of what is happening to the earth and its complement of life is also to be found in this problematic, in the logic of mastery, now being seared into the biosphere of an entire scarred and wounded planet as well as across its sociosphere. We have traced some of the progress of this cultural subject through the landscape of western intellectual history. He has explained, justified and naturalised his actions in colonising otherness in terms of a story about reason and nature which is written large on western culture and which increasingly guides human impacts on the earth and prevents a sustainable, mutual relationship with the planet. The master’s colonisation denies the other he calls nature in two main ways, both by denying self’s dependency on and relationship to it, and by denying and cancelling its independence of self.

正如我们所看到的，掌握的深层结构埋藏在西方知识框架和概念史的基础中。几乎没有一个主题或话题不被这些概念结构造成的二元论的绳结所缠绕。主人的殖民化逻辑是我们时代的主导逻辑。对发生在地球上的事情及其生命的补充的解释也可以在这个问题中找到，在主宰的逻辑中，现在被烙在整个伤痕累累的星球的生物圈中，以及在其社会圈内。我们已经通过西方思想史的景观追踪了这个文化主体的一些进展。他用一个关于理性和自然的故事来解释、证明和归化他的殖民行为，这个故事在西方文化中写得很多，它越来越多地指导着人类对地球的影响，并阻止与地球建立可持续的相互关系。主人的殖民化在两个主要方面否定了他所谓的自然，既否定了自我对它的依赖和关系，又否定和取消了它对自我的独立性。

We have seen how the meanings of reason and nature are multiple and have shifted, but how the strategies of mastery are still played out between the mastering one and dualised other. Variations in the concepts of nature and reason have enabled the long-running story of reason and nature to remain relevant, to guide changes in technological development and to provide a reliable conceptual response to widely varying circumstances and opportunities. The flexibility of these concepts has enabled the strategies of mastery to be transferred across sites of oppression as mastering reason invades and colonises those others counted as nature. In the range of plots which emanate from the master, from the perspective of power, nature is that other which is excluded from the sphere of ends. It is the name for all those whose own ends are denied and have disappeared, those seen as imposing no limits on the rational self. The master strategies of nullification apply to all of these. In our own time many of these meanings cluster especially around the concept of economic development.

我们已经看到，理性和自然的含义是怎样的多元，并发生了变化，但掌握的策略仍在掌握的一方和二元化的另一方之间进行着。自然和理性概念的变化使理性和自然的长期故事能够保持相关性，指导技术发展的变化，并对广泛变化的环境和机会提供可靠的概念反应。这些概念的灵活性使掌握的策略能够在压迫的地点之间转移，因为掌握的理性入侵和殖民那些被算作自然的其他人。在主宰者发出的一系列情节中，从权力的角度来看，自然是被排除在目的范围之外的那个其他人。它是所有那些自己的目的被否定和消失的人的名字，那些被视为对理性自我没有限制的人。无效化的主策略适用于所有这些。在我们自己的时代，这些含义中有许多是围绕着经济发展的概念。

We can understand the development of this story about reason and nature as a story whose stages correspond to the historical stages in the process of colonisation of otherness. With some room for variations, these progressive stages of the colonisation process can be represented (with somewhat arbitrary divisions) as justification and preparation, invasion and annexation, appropriation (instrumentalism) and incorporation (assimilation). In the first stage, the story is set up and the leading characters of mastering reason and the lower separate sphere of nature are established. This is the work of Plato and the early rationalists; in their time the invasion of otherness in non-human nature has not yet begun in earnest, but the master identity has established itself firmly in control of the lower orders of otherness classed as nature, as the master of animals, slaves, ‘barbarians’ and women, and has begun its colonisation of the human self and of culture. Plato also gives a lead to what is to come for non-human nature in his conception of ‘original’ matter as a chaotic and formless void empty of ends, uninhabited by qualities, on which mastering reason stamps itself as form, as the passive receptacle in which reason’s own ends and intelligence are implanted in a process which carries no element of mutuality.

我们可以把这个关于理性和自然的故事的发展理解为一个故事，它的各个阶段与其他事物的殖民化过程的历史阶段相对应。在有一定的变化空间的情况下，殖民化过程的这些渐进阶段可以被表示为（有些武断的划分）：证明和准备、入侵和吞并、占有（工具主义）和纳入（同化）。在第一阶段，故事被设定，掌握理性的主角和自然界的低级独立领域被确立。这是柏拉图和早期理性主义者的工作；在他们的时代，对非人类自然界中的他者的入侵还没有真正开始，但主宰身份已经牢牢控制了被归类为自然界的低级他者，成为动物、奴隶、"野蛮人 "和妇女的主人，并开始对人类自我和文化进行殖民。**柏拉图在他的概念中也为非人类自然界的未来提供了一个线索，他认为 "原始 "物质是一个混沌和无形的空洞，没有目的，没有品质，主宰的理性将自己作为形式印在上面，作为被动的容器，理性自己的目的和智慧在一个没有相互性因素的过程中被植入其中。**

This Platonic lead is followed in the second stage, that of invasion and annexation by later rationalists; as the invasion gets truly under way, Cartesian thought declares non-human nature terra nullius, uninhabited by mind, totally available for annexation, a sphere easily moulded to the ends of a reason conceived as without limits. After annexation, Locke shows how reason, in its next persona as selfcontained individual egoism or instrumental rationality, can profitably appropriate the whole sphere of ‘nature’ as its own individual property by dispossessing and making invisible previous inhabitants and their prior rights, whose agency is excluded by Eurocentric concepts of productive labour. The third stage, appropriation, reconceives rationality as egoism and nature in instrumental terms as a resource for the master. As we have seen, instrumentalism is not only a form of transformation of the other. It is one which gives the other’s ends no weight, treats it as a mere tool or means for ends that are not its own. This is the stage of the systematic searching out and exploitation of ‘use’ in nature, in which the rational ego is conceived as standing apart from the alien other, as the self-contained user of the item for consumption or resource for knowledge it now becomes. The other is reinvested with agency and purpose only through being brought captive as means within the master’s sphere of ends, through assimilation to the sphere of self via use, in commodification or consumption.

在第二阶段，即**后来的理性主义者的入侵和吞并阶段，柏拉图式的线索得到了遵循；当入侵真正开始时，笛卡尔思想宣布非人类的自然界是无主之地，不为心灵所居住，完全可以被吞并，这个领域很容易被塑造为一个被认为没有限制的理性的目的。**在吞并之后，洛克展示了理性如何以其下一个角色，即自足的个人利己主义或工具理性，通过剥夺并使先前的居民及其先前的权利不可见，从而有利地将整个 "自然 "领域作为其个人财产，而这些居民的机构被欧洲中心主义的生产劳动概念所排除。第三阶段，侵占，将理性重新理解为利己主义，并将自然界的工具性条款理解为主人的一种资源。正如我们所看到的，工具主义不仅是改造他人的一种形式。它不重视他人的目的，将其视为实现不属于自己的目的的单纯的工具或手段。这是系统地寻找和利用自然界中的 "使用 "的阶段，在这个阶段中，理性的自我被设想为独立于外来的他者，作为消费物品或知识资源的自足的使用者，它现在成为。他人只有通过被俘虏为主人的目的范围内的手段，通过商品化或消费中的使用同化为自我的范围，才能被重新赋予机构和目的。
