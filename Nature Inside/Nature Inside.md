We seem, today, to be infatuated with indoor plants and flowers. Many of our everyday public indoor spaces are full of them, while glossy magazines depict miniature jungles in stylish domestic interiors. In 2011, six fully grown English field maples and two hornbeams formed part of the lavish setting that framed Prince William and Catherine Middleton's wedding in Westminster Abbey, while the trio of glass orbs that form Amazon's headquarters in Seattle contain over 40,000 plants (opened 2018; fig. 1). In addition, countless health and leisure centres, hotel lobbies, exhibition halls, corporate offices, railway stations, airports and shopping malls across the globe house elaborate indoor planting schemes.

今天，我们似乎迷恋上了室内植物和花卉。我们的许多日常公共室内空间都充满了它们，而光鲜的杂志则描绘了时尚的家庭室内的微型丛林。2011年，在威廉王子和凯瑟琳-米德尔顿在威斯敏斯特大教堂举行的婚礼上，六棵完全生长的英国田园枫树和两棵黄杨构成了奢华的背景，而构成亚马逊西雅图总部的三个玻璃球里有超过4万棵植物（2018年开放；图1）。此外，全球无数的健康和休闲中心、酒店大堂、展览厅、公司办公室、火车站、机场和购物中心都有精心设计的室内种植方案。

Putting plants and flowers in containers and bringing them inside are not new activities, however. Egyptian, early Chinese and Middle Eastern civilisations embraced such practices, as did the ancient Greeks. The Romans grew plants in terracotta pots and filled the inner atria of their houses with them, though those spaces were open to the sky.? Yet despite these continuities, by the late eighteenth century nature inside had taken on multiple new meanings in the Western world. Tshis book sets out to tell a story about the inclusion of plants and flowers in interior spaces from that moment onwards, with an emphasis on developments in Britain, continental Europe and the United States. Through its emphasis on nature inside it aims to bring together into a single narrative a study of nineteenth-century domestic interiors and public winter gardens, with analyses of the interiors of canonical (and less canonical) examples of inter-war modernist, post-1945 late modernist and contemporary architecture.3

将植物和花卉放在容器中并将它们带入室内 然而，这并不是新的活动。埃及、早期中国和中东 东方文明都接受了这种做法，古希腊人也是如此。罗马人在陶罐中种植植物，并在房屋的内部中庭摆满植物。尽管这些空间是向天空开放的。然而，尽管有这些延续性，到18世纪末，自然 在西方世界，内部已经有了多种新的含义。**本书 本书旨在讲述一个关于从那时起将植物和花卉纳入室内空间的故事**。的故事，重点放在英国、欧洲大陆和美国的发展上。英国、欧洲大陆和美国的发展。通过对室内自然的强调，本书旨在将关于室内空间的研究集中到一个单一的叙述中。通过对室内自然的强调，该书旨在将对19世纪国内室内和公共冬季花园的研究纳入单一的叙述中。和公共冬季花园的研究，并对经典的（或不太经典的）室内装饰进行分析。(冬日花园的研究，同时b分析战时现代主义、1945年后现代主义和当代建筑的经典（和不太经典）案例。现代主义和当代建筑的内部分析。

Above all, this new narrative is characterised by continuity rather than, as is usually presented, by the disruptive shift from nineteenth- century historicism and eclecticism to modernist minimalism and beyond. 'Modernity provokes on all levels an aesthetic of rupture' the French cultural theorist Jean Baudrillard has written.4 In this book, by contrast, numerous twentieth- and twenty-first-century interiors are unpacked in the context of nineteenth-century ideas and practices related to bringing nature inside. While the functions and meanings of indoor nature have inevitably changed over time, its roles as an aide-memoire of the pre-industrial past, as a form of therapy for human beings, and as an active agent in the creation of a non-toxic environment have arguably remained intact through the whole period. Providing a counterpoint to rapid urbanisation, to the hard forms and materials of modern architecture, and to the cultural dominance of advanced technologies, in a variety of ways nature inside has consistentlv offered a much-needed anchor to otherwise unchained 'progress!

最重要的是，这种新叙事的特点是连续性，而不是像通常所说的那样，**从19世纪的历史主义和折衷主义到现代主义极简主义及其他的破坏性转变。**法国文化理论家Jean Baudrillard写道："现代性在所有层面上都引发了一种断裂美学"。4 相比之下，在这本书中，许多20世纪和21世纪的室内装饰都是在19世纪与将自然带入室内有关的想法和实践的背景下进行的。**虽然室内自然的功能和意义不可避免地随着时间的推移而改变，但它作为前工业时代的备忘录，作为人类的一种治疗方式，以及作为创造无毒环境的积极因素的作用，可以说在整个时期都保持不变。**与快速的城市化、现代建筑的硬形式和材料以及先进技术的文化主导地位相对应的是，自然界始终以各种方式为其他不受约束的 "进步 "提供了一个亟需的锚。

Historians of interiors rarely address the aspidistra in the corner, or the vase of flowers on the table. Plants and flowers grow and die, and are often thought to have been put in place at the last minute for photographers. Ignored as vital components of spaces, they are relegated to the inferior status of representations of nature, mere onlookers in the interiors they occupy. On one level, therefore, this book offers a new account of the history of modern architecture and interior design that focuses on the presence of plants and flowers in otherwise exclusively cultural settings. Given that this is a design-historical study, the structure of the book follows a familiar chronological narrative that moves through Victorian historicism to European modernism and on to American and global late modernism. This time, however, that well-trodden path is viewed through a completely new lens.

室内历史学家很少谈到角落里的天门冬，或桌子上的花瓶。植物和花卉的生长和死亡，往往被认为是在最后一刻才被放置在摄影者身上。作为空间的重要组成部分，它们被贬低为自然的代表，仅仅是它们所处的室内的旁观者。因此，从某种程度上说，**这本书对现代建筑和室内设计的历史提供了一个新的说明，即关注植物和花卉在其他纯文化环境中的存在。考虑到这是一项设计历史研究，本书的结构遵循了一个熟悉的年代叙事，即从维多利亚历史主义到欧洲现代主义，再到美国和全球晚期现代主义。**这一次。然而，这一次，我们通过一个全新的视角来看待这条已经走过的道路。

The book begins by explaining that nature inside first emerged in the modern Western world in the context of the overseas trade and the acquisition of plants and flowers from European colonies that took place from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries. As increasing numbers of people became urban dwellers, however, the established relationship between nature and human beings reached a crisis. The deliberate rejection of nature that came with increasing industrialisation brought with it a reaction in the form of romanticism, which manifested at a high cultural level in poetry and music, and was represented in a more popular form by, among other phenomena, the desire to bring nature, in the shape of plants and flowers, inside. Quite quickly, plants' and flowers' newly acquired messages about taste, fashion and respectable middle-class domesticity were also injected into the public sphere, where they were often used instrumentally to conceal rampant commercialism.

该书一开始就解释说，在现代西方世界中，自然界首次出现在海外贸易和从欧洲殖民地收购植物和花卉的背景下，这些都发生在17世纪到19世纪。**然而，随着越来越多的人成为城市居民，自然和人类之间的既定关系达到了一个危机。随着工业化程度的提高，对自然的刻意排斥带来了浪漫主义的反应，**这种反应在诗歌和音乐中表现出较高的文化水平，并以更流行的形式表现出来，**除其他现象外，还包括将自然（以植物和花朵的形式）带入室内的愿望。很快，植物和花卉新获得的关于品味、时尚和可敬的中产阶级家庭的信息也被注入了公共领域**，在那里它们经常被用来掩盖猖獗的商业主义。

In the inter-war years of the twentieth century a sharp shift occurred away from nature inside's integration into popular culture and links to nineteenth-century modernity. Instead, it took on a new role within the radical ideas about architecture and interiors which defined the high-cultural movement that emerged in the West, known today as modernism. In spite of that movement's declared rejection of domesticity, plants and flowers continued to play a significant part in the interior schemes of many modernist buildings. However, neither the architect-designers of the time nor the later historians of the movement acknowledged their important role.

**在二十世纪的战时年代，发生了一个急剧的转变，即不再将自然融入大众文化并与十九世纪的现代性挂钩。相反，它在关于建筑和室内的激进思想中扮演了新的角色，这些思想定义了在西方出现的高级文化运动，也就是今天的<u>现代主义</u>。**尽管该运动宣称拒绝家庭生活，但植物和花卉在许多现代主义建筑的内部方案中仍然发挥着重要作用。然而，无论是当时的建筑设计师还是后来的运动历史学家都不承认他们的重要作用。

In the years after 1945 the movement of architectural and design modernism across the Atlantic facilitated two important developments. First, due to the fine weather on North America's west coast, the Californian modernist architects who moved there from Europe realised fully what had been only a dream up to that point, namely the erosion of the boundary between residential architecture's inside and outside spaces; between, that is, nature and culture. Second, for reasons not unlike those which had drawn nature out of the private sphere in the late nineteenth century, as a result of the United States' post-war economic boom, many large public and semi-public late-modern interiors also began to embrace nature inside.

在1945年之后的几年里，建筑和设计现代主义跨越大西洋的运动促进了两个重要发展。首先，由于北美西海岸的好天气，从欧洲搬到那里的加利福尼亚现代主义建筑师们完全实现了到那时为止的梦想，即住宅建筑的内部和外部空间之间的界限被侵蚀；**也就是说，在自然和文化之间。其次，由于与19世纪末将自然从私人领域引出的原因不尽相同，作为美国战后经济繁荣的结果，许多大型公共和半公共的晚期现代室内装饰也开始将自然纳入其中。**

Finally, in the period from 1970 to the present, a desire to subject indoor plants and flowers to scientific scrutiny came to the fore. Evidence from this research was used to reassure the managers of commercial spaces that investing in indoor planting could contribute to their profits. The plantscaping profession emerged on the back of this. Plants and flowers have now penetrated indoor environments globally on an unprecedented scale, and their meanings have become inextricably entangled with the popular environmental movement.

最后，从1970年到现在，将室内植物和花卉置于科学审查之下的愿望开始凸显。**这项研究的证据被用来向商业空间的管理者保证，投资于室内植物可以为他们的利润做出贡献。在此背景下，植物造景行业应运而生。**现在，植物和花卉已经以前所未有的规模渗透到全球的室内环境中，**它们的意义已经与流行的环保运动密不可分**。

Over the years nature inside has become, in turn, a commodity, a marker of colonial power, a sign of aristocratic wealth and status, a component of Victorian middle-class feminine domesticity, an aesthetic strategy within European modernist architecture, a humanising factor within late modernism in the private and public spheres, a tool within late economic capitalism, a subject of the modern scientific paradigm and a marker of the environmental crisis.

**多年来，大自然反过来成为一种商品、殖民权力的标志、贵族财富和地位的标志、维多利亚时代中产阶级女性家庭生活的组成部分、欧洲现代主义建筑的审美策略、后期现代主义在私人和公共领域的人性化因素、后期经济资本主义的工具、现代科学范式的主体以及环境危机的标志。**

This book uses many examples to illustrate its vast subject. Together they tell a story of the main trends and ideas that drove the movement of nature inside. Several of the individual plants used in the interior settings under review - including the palm, the fern, the cactus, the Swiss cheese plant and the rubber plant - have been singled out as representatives of the moments in which they were both fashionable and meaningful. The focus throughout the book is on real plants located in actual interiors rather than on the multiple ways in which nature has been represented in paintings, on wallpaper and on furnishing fabrics, or imagined in idealised settings. The aim has been to add the idea of the 'natural' to the categories of the visual, the material and the spatial.

本书用许多例子来说明其庞大的主题。它们共同讲述了一个推动自然界内部运动的主要趋势和想法的故事。在审查的室内环境中使用的一些个别植物--包括棕榈、蕨类、仙人掌、瑞士奶酪植物和橡胶植物--被挑出来作为它们既时尚又有意义的代表。**本书的重点是位于实际室内的真实植物，而不是在绘画、墙纸和家具织物上表现自然的多种方式，或在理想化的环境中想象。我们的目的是将 "自然 "的概念添加到视觉、材料和空间的类别中。**

In addition to the case made for historical continuity, which sits at the heart of this study, four important themes weave in and out of its narrative. First, the commodification of plants was a by-product of the colonial aims of classification, control and ownership. Also, without the trading that took place during the colonial era, most of the plants that were subsequently used in inside spaces would never have left their native lands. The legacy of colonialism is therefore felt throughout this story.

除了作为本研究核心的历史连续性的案例外，还有四个重要的主题在其叙述中交织在一起。**首先，植物的商品化是分类、控制和所有权等殖民主义目标的副产品。**另外，如果没有殖民时代的贸易，大多数后来被用于内部空间的植物都不会离开它们的故土。因此，在这个故事中可以感受到**殖民主义的遗产**。

Second, an association between nature and the female gender occurs as a leitmotif throughout this study, especially, unsurprisingly, in the context of the domestic sphere. The facts that nineteenth-century greenhouses were usually attached to ladies' rooms; that the responsibility for nineteenth-century window gardening lay with female amateur interior decorators; that several female architects and designers, among them Lilly Reich, Aino Aalto and Ray Eames, were probably responsible for introducing nature into the interiors of buildings designed by their modernist husbands and partners; and that the ecofeminist movement, which emerged in the 1980s, has played such a key role within recent environmental politics, all support that association.s

第二，自然和女性之间的联系作为主题词出现在本研究中，特别是在家庭领域的背景下，这一点并不令人惊讶。十九世纪的温室通常附属于女士的房间；十九世纪的窗户园艺由女性业余室内装饰师负责；一些女性建筑师和设计师，包括Lilly Reich、Aino Aalto和Ray Eames，可能负责将自然引入其现代主义丈夫和伙伴设计的建筑物的内部；以及1980年代出现的生态女性主义运动在最近的环境政治中发挥了如此重要的作用，这些事实都支持这种联系。

The practice of adding plants and flowers to interiors began, in an upper-class setting, as an extension of (male) gardening. It subsequently moved into the hands of middle-class housewives where, in the context of the domestic sphere, it has largely remained. As the activity became widespread in the public arena it became the responsibility of a range of (predominantly male) professionals: architects, interior decorators and designers, landscape architects and, latterly, the more specialist interiorscapers and plantscapers. The book also sets out to recount that gendered story.

在室内添加植物和花卉的做法开始于上层社会，是（男性）园艺的一种延伸。随后，它进入了中产阶级家庭主妇的手中，在家庭领域的背景下，它在很大程度上保持着。随着这项活动在公共领域的普及，它成为一系列（主要是男性）专业人士的责任：建筑师、室内装饰师和设计师、景观建筑师，以及后来更专业的室内装饰师和植物种植师。本书也致力于叙述这个性别化的故事。

Thirdly, while plants and flowers were embraced in a range of private, semi-private and public indoor spaces throughout the period under review, the intentions behind their inclusion in those different arenas varied considerably." In the private home, individuals benefited directly, both physically and psychologically, from the presence of indoor nature and its ability to absorb toxins from the air and oxygenate it. Once nature inside entered the commercial arena, however, it was frequently used to further the ends of economic capitalism. Human beings, it was believed, worked and shopped harder when they were surrounded by relaxing plants.

第三，**虽然在整个审查期间，植物和花卉被纳入一系列私人、半私人和公共室内空间，但它们被纳入这些不同领域背后的意图有很大不同。在私人住宅中，个人在身体和心理上都直接受益于室内自然的存在及其吸收空气中的毒素和氧气的能力。然而，一旦室内自然进入商业领域，它就经常被用来促进经济资本主义的目的。人们认为，当人类被轻松的植物包围时，他们会更努力地工作和购物。**

p13

Finally, the idea that plants and flowers are active rather than passive inhabitants of inside spaces also pervades the pages of this book. In the final decades of the twentieth century the French philosopher Bruno Latour. together with members of the environmentalist movement, suggested that human beings are not alone in being able to exercise agency." In 2004, claiming that 'plants can curry favour with their surrounding humans by showing what attractive displays they might create if given enough care, Russell Hitchings even suggested that, though human beings believe thev control nature, the truth may be the reverse: that nature is controlling them. 8

最后，植物和花卉是内部空间的主动而非被动居民的想法也充斥着本书的页面**。在二十世纪的最后几十年里，法国哲学家布鲁诺-拉图尔（Bruno Latour）与环保主义运动的成员一起提出，人类并不是唯一能够行使代理权的人"。**2004年，罗素-希钦斯声称，"植物可以通过展示它们在得到足够的照顾后可能创造出的诱人的展示来讨好周围的人类，他甚至提出，尽管人类认为自己控制了自然，但事实可能恰恰相反：自然正在控制他们。8

Although this book deals specifically with the story of indoor plants and flowers, it is also important to remember that they function as representatives of nature in its entirety. They are, therefore, implicated in the complex debates that have taken place over many years about the relationship between nature and culture. **Since the eighteenth century these two concepts have been understood as having a dualistic relationship, one which many ecologically oriented writers see as lying at the heart of today's environmental issues.9 Nature became a (near) component of culture through its commodification from the eighteenth century onwards.10** Its presence in inside spaces - that is, in the human-constructed visual, material and spatial phenomena we call 'interiors' - brought it even closer to culture. As a result, plants and flowers became quasi-objects, contained and displayed in inside spaces. That double layering of cultural formation makes this study's task of deciphering the role of indoor plants and flowers a complex one.

尽管本书专门讨论了室内植物和花卉的故事，但同样重要的是要记住，**它们作为整个自然界的代表发挥作用**。因此，它们牵涉到多年来关于自然和文化之间关系的复杂争论中。**<u>自十八世纪以来，这两个概念被理解为具有二元关系，许多生态学导向的作家认为这种关系是当今环境问题的核心所在。</u>**从十八世纪开始，<u>**自然通过商品化成为文化的一个（近乎）组成部分**。</u>1 **它在内部空间的存在--也就是在我们称之为 "室内 "的人类建造的视觉、物质和空间现象中--使它与文化更加接近。因此，植物和花卉成为准物体，被包含并展示在内部空间。这种文化形成的双重分层使得本研究破译室内植物和花卉的作用成为一项复杂的任务。**

Indoor plants and flowers are also emblematic of humanity's anxieties about the growing imbalance in its relationship with nature. That disharmony is a cumulative consequence of the control people have exerted over nature for centuries. Indeed, the strong concern that is felt about environmental issues in the early twenty-first century, and its eco-feminist implications, lay behind my decision to write about indoor plants and flowers in the first place.

**室内植物和花卉也象征着人类对其与自然关系日益失衡的焦虑**。这种不和谐是几个世纪以来人们对自然界的控制所造成的累积性后果。事实上，在21世纪初，人们对环境问题的强烈关注，以及它的生态女性主义影响，是我决定首先写室内植物和花卉的原因。

While, on one level, this book adds a new dimension to the familiar histories of interior decoration and design from the late eighteenth century to the present, on another, it provides fresh insights into human beings' ever-changing relationship with the natural world over that period. It also acknowledges that all those responsible for bringing nature inside over the period under review largely understood, whether consciously or subconsciously, that indoor plants and flowers exert a level of agency. Finally, it lays the groundwork for the idea that, if human beings could recognise the importance of nature in an indoor setting, they might begin to develop a new respect for the entire natural environment.

从某种程度上说，这本书为我们熟悉的十八世纪末至今的室内装饰和设计历史增加了一个新的维度，而从另一个角度来说，**它为这一时期人类与自然界不断变化的关系提供了新的见解。**它还承认，在本报告所述期间，所有负责将自然带入室内的人，不管是有意识的还是下意识的，基本上都明白室内植物和花卉发挥了一定程度的作用。最后，它为以下想法奠定了基础：**<u>如果人类能够认识到自然在室内环境中的重要性，他们可能开始对整个自然环境产生新的尊重。</u>**

Plants seldom figure in the grand narratives of war, peace, or even everyday life in proportion to their importance to humans. Yet they are significant natural and cultural artifacts, often at the center of high intrigue.'

在战争、和平、甚至是日常生活的宏大叙事中，植物很少出现。与它们对人类的重要性成正比。然而，它们 它们是重要的自然和文化艺术品，经常处于高度阴谋的中心。高级阴谋的中心。

**The years between 1600 and 1914 - the era of modernity in the Western world - saw wild nature subordinated to the will, authority and desires of human beings. An important part of that subordination was represented by nature's physical containment in a range of inside spaces located in both the public and the private spheres. Several drivers propelled that taming of the jungle. Through the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the curiosity, acquisitiveness and delight in exotic luxuries that underpinned Europe's desire to control overseas territories led to the importation of non-native natural species from the colonies. Taming nature both mitigated the fear of the 'other' and played an important part in the financial exploitation that was part and parcel of colonialism. While the practical applications of plants expanded over the period in question - herbs, drugs, spices, dyes, and a range of food, drinks and other products (such as sugar, tea, coffee and textiles) were traded widely - plants and flowers themselves also became desirable luxury commodities. They were nurtured by horticulturists in commercial nurseries and by botanists in botanical gardens, a process which assisted in their transformation from natural phenomena into (near) cultural artefacts.**

**在1600年至1914年期间--西方世界的现代性时代--野生自然被置于人类的意志、权威和欲望之下。这种从属关系的一个重要部分是将自然界实际控制在位于公共和私人领域的一系列内部空间中。有几个因素推动了对丛林的驯服。在16、17和18世纪，欧洲控制海外领土的欲望所支撑的好奇心、获取欲和对异国奢侈品的喜悦，导致了从殖民地进口非本地自然物种。驯服自然既减轻了对 "他人 "的恐惧，又在作为殖民主义组成部分的金融剥削中发挥了重要作用。在这一时期，植物的实际应用不断扩大--草药、药物、香料、染料以及一系列食品、饮料和其他产品（如糖、茶、咖啡和纺织品）被广泛交易--植物和花卉本身也成为理想的奢侈商品。它们在商业苗圃中由园艺师培育，在植物园中由植物学家培育，这一过程有助于它们从自然现象转变为（近乎）文化艺术品。**

**Plant-hunting, which emerged in the seventeenth century, represented one branch of the commercial activity that defined European colonialism. Hunters sought to augment the supply of plants for the manufacture of the plant-related products listed above, to acquire specimens for scientific research, to meet the requirements of the growing numbers of plant collectors, to provide plants for the many commercial nurseries that were setting up in business, and to increase the supply of exotic plants for wealthy landowners who were growing them on their estates.**

**17世纪出现的植物狩猎，是欧洲殖民主义商业活动的一个分支。狩猎者试图增加植物供应，以制造上述与植物有关的产品，为科学研究获取标本，满足越来越多的植物收藏家的要求，为正在建立的许多商业苗圃提供植物，并为在其庄园中种植植物的富裕地主增加外来植物供应。**

Intrepid hunter-explorers were sent abroad by private collectors, kings, scientific academies and governments. Many of the early English hunters were physicians who worked on ships in that capacity. Notable among them was Sir Hans Sloane (fig. 2), the physician to Queen Anne and to kings George I and George I. Among his numerous botanical voyages, Sloane travelled to Jamaica in 1687, where he hunted for new drugs.? Physicians were soon joined by horticulturists and botanists. Sir Joseph Banks - a well-known naturalist and botanist who was president, from 1778, of the Royal Society, and an informal advisor to George III at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, from 1797 - believed that horticulture and botany would benefit the nation financially.3 By the middle of the eighteenth century trees were arriving in Britain from America, and by the end of it numerous plants from Africa, Australia and the Far East were also making an appearance.+ By the early decades of the nineteenth century, growing exotic flowers and shrubs had become a possibility for many of Europe's gardeners.

无畏的狩猎探险家们被私人收藏家、国王、科学院和政府派往国外。许多早期的英国猎人是在船上工作的医生，他们以这种身份工作。其中值得一提的是汉斯-斯隆爵士（图2），他是安妮女王以及乔治一世和乔治一世国王的医生。在他众多的植物学航行中，斯隆于1687年前往牙买加，在那里寻找新药物。园艺师和植物学家很快就加入了医生的行列。约瑟夫-班克斯爵士--著名的自然学家和植物学家，从1778年起担任英国皇家学会主席，从1797年起担任乔治三世在邱皇家植物园的非正式顾问--认为园艺和植物学将使国家在财政上受益。到十八世纪中叶，树木从美洲运抵英国，到十八世纪末，来自非洲、澳大利亚和远东的众多植物也开始出现了。

The British East India Company, which was founded in 1599, and the Dutch East India Company, established three years later, played key roles in the transportation of plants and flowers from the colonies to Europe. The latter operated for two centuries from the Cape of Good Hope to Japan. The Dutch West India Company, established in 1621, undertook its activities in West Africa, the Caribbean and North and South America. Their ships moved around the globe on new trade routes and supplied Europe with tea and silk from China, sugar and coffee from the West Indies, spices from the East Indies, and corn and tobacco from the American colonies, By the early eighteenth century both seeds and living plants - including ericas, geraniums, pelargoniums, succulents and proteaceous plants from the Cape of South Africa - were also being brought to Europe on the trading ships.6

成立于1599年的英国东印度公司和三年后成立的荷兰东印度公司，在从殖民地向欧洲运输植物和花卉方面发挥了关键作用。后者从好望角到日本经营了两个世纪。荷兰西印度公司成立于1621年，在西非、加勒比海和南、北美洲开展活动。他们的船只在新的贸易路线上环游世界，向欧洲提供来自中国的茶叶和丝绸、来自西印度群岛的糖和咖啡、来自东印度群岛的香料以及来自美洲殖民地的玉米和烟草。到18世纪初，种子和活体植物--包括来自南非角的紫罗兰、天竺葵、天竺葵、肉质植物和蛋白植物--也被商船带到了欧洲。

Before they were physically brought into the interior, the exotic plants and flowers that were transported to Europe were subjected to interventions by both scientists and artists. From the seventeenth century onwards the number of scientific publications increased in England and scientific work was facilitated by learned societies, among them the Royal Society, which was founded in 1660. The interest of horticulturists, botanists and taxonomists in plants as objects of scientific investigation represented a desire to assert the Enlightenment belief in the pre-eminence of reason over emotion and intuition.

在它们被实际带入内地之前，被运到欧洲的异国植物和花卉都受到了科学家和艺术家的干预。从17世纪开始，英国的科学出版物数量增加，科学工作得到了学术协会的推动，其中包括1660年成立的皇家学会。园艺师、植物学家和分类学家对作为科学调查对象的植物的兴趣，代表了对启蒙运动中理性高于情感和直觉的信念的渴望。

One way in which the desire to subordinate nature to reason manifested was in the drive to formulate a system of classification, a taxonomy, that would provide shared names for previouslv unknown plants. As Londa Schiebinger has explained, 'Europe's naturalists not only collected the stuff of nature but lay their own peculiar grid of reason over nature so that nomenclatures and taxonomies often served as "tools of empire". '7 Antonio Lafuente and Nuria Valverde reiterated her point when they wrote that 'Empire requires that scientists and their patrons share the belief that the stuff of nature can be captured in words, figures, lines, shading, gradients, or flows', reinforcing the idea that nature was controlled by the application of both reason and language.& The philosopher Val Plumwood has pointed out that naming something, as Christopher Columbus named the lands he discovered, is a way of claiming ownership and therefore of asserting control.?

使自然服从于理性的方式是formulate(制定)命名分类系统为过去未知的植物提供共同的名称。**<u>正如Londa Schiebinger所解释的那样，"欧洲的博物学家不仅收集自然界的东西，而且将他们自己特有的理性格局置于自然界之上，因此，命名和分类法往往成为 "帝国的工具"。</u>**安东尼奥-拉丰特和努里娅-瓦尔维德重申了她的观点，他们写道："帝国要求科学家和他们的赞助人都相信，自然界的东西可以用文字、数字、线条、阴影、梯度或流动来捕捉"，加强了自然界被理性和语言应用所控制的想法。

**citation:** Antonio Lafuente and Nuria Valverde reiterated her point when they wrote the stuff of nature can be captured in words, figures, lines, shading ,gradients, or flows', reinforcing the idea that nature was controlled by the application of both reason and language (Lafuente and Valverde, 2007, p. 134). 自然可以被文字，数字，线条，阴影，渐变或者流动捕捉到，表现出来。加强了自然可以被理性和语言控制的想法。

The philosopher Val Plumwood has pointed out that naming something, as Christopher Columbus named the lands he discovered, is a way of claiming ownership and therefore of asserting control (Plumwood, 1993, p. 158).哲学家指出像哥伦布命名新大陆那样，命名是一种宣示主权宣示控制的方式。

The Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus established a system whereby names of plants were authenticated by mounting dried plant specimens onto cards that were then stored in buildings called herbaria, many of which were linked to botanical gardens. In the years under review, those gardens gradually moved away from medicine and reoriented themselves towards scientific research. **The French philosopher Michel Foucault has claimed that Linnaeus's work was crucial to the process of disciplining the hitherto 'unwieldy stuff of nature', while, according to Schiebinger, it constituted "the starting point for modern botany in the twentieth century: 10**

瑞典植物学家卡尔-林奈Carl Linnaeus建立了一个系统，凭借通过将干的植物标本裱贴在卡片上的方式鉴定植物名称，之后储存到被称为herbaria植物标本存放室的地方，其中许多标本馆连接了植物的花园。在审查的这些年里，这些花园逐渐远离了医学，并将自己重新定位为科学研究。**<u>法国哲学家米歇尔-福柯（Michel Foucault）声称，林奈的工作对于规范迄今为止 "自然界的不稳定因素 "的过程至关重要，而根据谢宾格Schiebinger的说法，它构成了 "20世纪现代植物学的起点：10</u>**

Aesthetic control over tamed plants and flowers was exerted by the British rural elite, who integrated them into the constructed landscapes on their estates (fig. 3). Taming nature by transforming it into aesthetically conceived gardens went back many centuries. By the eighteenth century the international focus was on Britain, where the so-called 'natural' garden had come to prominence, succeeding the earlier, more formal, European baroque garden." The notion of the 'picturesque' also emerged at that time, an aesthetic ideal that was based on the concepts of beauty and the sublime as they were perceived by viewers moving through spatial settings. This celebration of the picturesque led to the ideas that the natural world was pleasing to human beings and that it exerted a form of agency which compelled humans to engage with it. In subsequent years, the picturesque aesthetic was also to underpin the ways in which tamed plants and flowers were arranged in indoor settings.

英国农村精英对被驯服的植物和花卉进行了审美控制，他们将这些植物和花卉融入其庄园的建筑景观中（图3）。通过将自然转化为美学构想的花园来驯服自然可以追溯到许多世纪以前。到了18世纪，国际焦点集中在英国，在那里，**所谓的'自然'花园已经崭露头角，继承了早期更正式的欧洲巴洛克式花园"。**当时还出现了 "风景如画 "的概念，这是一种审美理想，它基于观众在空间环境中移动时所感知的美和崇高的概念。这种对风景画的赞美导致了这样的想法，即自然界对人类来说是令人愉悦的，而且它发挥了某种形式的作用，迫使人类与它接触。在随后的几年里，如诗如画的美学也成为了驯服的植物和花卉在室内环境中的安排方式的基础。

p18 'natural' garden had come to prominence, succeeding the baroque garden. The picturesque aesthetic was also to underpin the ways in whcih tamed plants and flowers were arranged in indoor settings. ‘自然的’花园成为主流，超越了巴洛克式的花园。古雅美学将巩固被驯化的植物和花朵安排在室内环境的方式

Many English gardens were designed and installed by a small number of hugely successful landscape gardeners, William Kent, Lancelot 'Capability' Brown and Humphry Repton among them. As well as creating gardens for Chiswick House in London, Kent also worked at Stowe House in Buckinghamshire and Rousham House in Oxfordshire, among other places. Brown's work included gardens at Petworth House in Sussex and at Tottenham Park in Wiltshire, while Repton was known for several garden designs including his work at Wembley Park in London, Blaise Castle near Bristol and Woburn Abbey, Bedfordshire. In the words of Andrea Wulf, by the eighteenth century landscape gardens had 'become the absolute Necessities of Life, without which a gentleman of the smallest fortune thinks he makes no Figure in the country! 12 When the 3rd Earl of Burlington created his garden at Chiswick House, he proclaimed that 'botany and horticulture were unimportant compared with the architectural embellishment of the garden'13 Sometimes artistically oriented landscape gardening could be combined with scientific enquiry, as wealthy landowners, such as the Duchess of Beaufort, frequently supported important horticultural innovations by helping to acclimatise plants imported from overseas. 14 For the most part, though, landscape gardening remained a purely aesthetic activity.

许多英国花园是由少数非常成功的风景园林师设计和安装的，威廉-肯特、兰斯洛特-布朗（Lancelot 'Capability' Brown）和汉弗莱-雷普顿就是其中之一。除了为伦敦的Chiswick House设计花园外，肯特还在白金汉郡的Stowe House和牛津郡的Rousham House以及其他地方工作。布朗的作品包括苏塞克斯的佩特沃斯宫和威尔特郡的托特纳姆公园的花园，而雷普顿则以多个花园设计而闻名，包括他在伦敦的温布利公园、布里斯托尔附近的布莱斯城堡和贝德福德郡的沃本修道院的作品。用**Andrea Wulf的话说，到了18世纪，景观花园已经 "成为生活的绝对必需品，没有它，一个财富最少的绅士都会认为他在乡下没有任何地位** "12 当Burlington第三代伯爵在Chiswick House建造他的花园时，他宣称 "植物学是最重要的。他宣称，"与花园的建筑装饰相比，植物学和园艺学并不重要 "13 有时，以艺术为导向的景观园艺可以与科学探索相结合，因为富有的地主，如博福特公爵夫人，经常通过帮助从海外进口的植物适应环境来支持重要的园艺创新。14 但在大多数情况下，景观园艺仍然是一种纯粹的审美活动。
Plants were not only politically, economically, scientifically and aesthetically controlled in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; they were also physically contained in several different ways. Their transportation from the tropics and their cultivation in botanical gardens, commercial nurseries, the private estates of the wealthy and aristocratic, and eventually the conservatories attached to middle-class homes, required them to be enclosed. Whether in cases, orangeries, glasshouses, conservatories, winter gardens or palm houses, plants and flowers experienced levels of containment that they had not known in their natural state.
**在十八和十九世纪，植物不仅在政治上、经济上、科学上和审美上受到控制；它们还以几种不同的方式受到实际控制。它们从热带地区运来，在植物园、商业苗圃、富人和贵族的私人庄园以及最终附属于中产阶级住宅的温室中栽培，都需要将它们封闭起来。**无论是在箱子、橘子园、玻璃温室、温室、冬季花园还是棕榈树屋中，植物和花卉都经历了它们在自然状态下不曾有过的封闭程度。
Up until the mid-nineteenth century a variety of containers were used to transport plants. Some were barrel-shaped, incorporating metal mesh to allow air to reach the plants; others were wooden-lidded boxes with compartments; others were open-ended, once again to let air in; and yet others were made of glass. It was not until 1829 that a breakthrough came, however, with the accidental discovery by a physician and amateur naturalist, Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward, of a plant transportation box that was left closed during journeys. It became known as the 'Wardian case' (fig. 4). The fact that it was sealed allowed water vapour to condense and run down inside its glass walls to be reabsorbed by the plants. In the ecosystem thus created, plants survived exceptionally well. The botanist, garden designer and author John Loudon was the first to realise the advantages of the new discovery, and the new cases were first used in 1848 by the botanist and plant hunter Robert Fortune for transporting tea plants to India from China. **Their widespread use on ships from the 1850s onwards resulted in a huge growth in the importation to Europe of exotic plants from the tropics.** As a result, commercial nurseries were able to stock many more such plants than hitherto, and to sell them at lower prices than ever before.
直到19世纪中期，人们一直使用各种容器来运输植物。有些是桶状的，里面有金属网，以便让空气进入植物；有些是有隔间的木盖箱；有些是开放式的，同样是为了让空气进入；还有一些是玻璃制成的。然而，直到1829年，一位医生和业余博物学家纳撒尼尔-巴格肖-沃德意外地发现了一种植物运输箱，在旅途中被关闭，这才取得了突破性进展。它被称为 "Wardian箱"（图4）。由于它是密封的，因此水蒸气可以在其玻璃墙内凝结并流下，被植物重新吸收。在这样创建的生态系统中，植物的生存状况非常好。植物学家、花园设计师和作家约翰-劳登是第一个意识到这一新发现的优势的人，1848年，植物学家和植物猎人罗伯特-富兰克林首次使用这种新箱子，将茶树从中国运往印度。从19世纪50年代起，这些箱子在船上的广泛使用导致了从热带地区向欧洲进口外来植物的巨大增长。因此，商业苗圃能够储存比以往更多的此类植物，并以比以往更低的价格出售这些植物。

On their arrival in Europe, the exotic plants and flowers needed to be contained within controlled environments so as to ensure their survival. Besides those destined for commercial nurseries, by the eighteenth century many of the plants brought back by the travelling physicians, horticulturists, botanists and hunter-explorers were deposited in botanical gardens. These had developed from the mid-sixteenth-century physic gardens attached to several Italian universities, including those in Pisa, Florence, Padua and Bologna, which had focused on the academic study of medicinal plants. The Italian model had spread to Europe through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with new botanical gardens emerging in Spain and northern Europe. By the first half of the eighteenth  century, yet more had been established in the North American colonies.外来植物和花卉到达欧洲后，需要被控制在受控的环境中，以确保其生存。除了用于商业苗圃的植物外，到18世纪，由旅行医生、园艺师、植物学家和狩猎探险家带回的许多植物都被存放在植物园里。这些植物园是在16世纪中叶意大利几所大学的附属植物园的基础上发展起来的，包括比萨、佛罗伦萨、帕多瓦和博洛尼亚的大学，这些大学专注于药用植物的学术研究。意大利的模式在十六和十七世纪传播到欧洲，新的植物园在西班牙和北欧出现。到十八世纪上半叶，在北美殖民地建立了更多的植物园。

By the end of that century the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, originally established in 1759, and the Real Jardín Botánico de Madrid, which opened four ears earlier, had moved from academic work to supporting international trade in plants. Under the informal directorship of Sir Joseph Banks, Kew, for example, sent collectors to the South African Cape, Australia, Chile, China, Ceylon and Brazil, among other places. New gardens were also established in the tropics to enable plants to be looked after locally. The British opened the Calcutta Botanic Garden in 1786; the French set up Pamplemousses Botanic Garden in Mauritius in 1735; and the Real Jardín Botánico de Madrid established the botanical gardens of La Orotava in Tenerife. By the early nineteenth century many more botanical gardens had been founded in countries across the globe, including Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Ceylon, Egypt, South Africa and Russia.

到该世纪末，最初成立于1759年的邱园皇家植物园和早在4年前开放的马德里皇家植物园已经从学术工作转向支持植物的国际贸易。例如，在约瑟夫-班克斯爵士的非正式领导下，邱园向南非角、澳大利亚、智利、中国、锡兰和巴西等地派遣了采集员。在热带地区也建立了新的花园，使植物能够在当地得到照顾。英国人于1786年开设了加尔各答植物园；法国人于1735年在毛里求斯建立了Pamplemousses植物园；马德里皇家植物园在特内里费岛建立了La Orotava植物园。到十九世纪初，全球各国又建立了许多植物园，包括新加坡、澳大利亚、新西兰、锡兰、埃及、南非和俄罗斯。

Plant-filled greenhouses and conservatories were constructed in many of the botanical gardens. Built to support plants arriving from warm climates, one of the first appeared in Chelsea's Physic Garden in 1680. By the middle of the nineteenth century their numbers had increased significantly. The Tropical Palm House in Edinburgh's Royal Botanic Garden was constructed in 1834; the Jardin des Plantes in Paris included a Mexican Hothouse, built between 1834 and 1836 by Charles Rohault de Fleury; and the palm house in Belfast's botanical gardens was constructed in 1839.16 Many more emerged in subsequent decades. Later examples include Edinburgh’s Temperate House, constructed in 1858 (fig. 5), and palm houses built in Copenhagen and Florence c.1874. Strasbourg's was built between 1877 and 1882; in 1907 the Tropical House in the Royal Botanic Garden, Dahlem, Berlin, was opened, and the Palm House in Amsterdam's Hortus  Botanicus was completed five years later. 17 Similar developments took place across the Atlantic: the conservatory in New York's Botanical Garden, for instance, was built between 1899 and 1902.许多植物园都建造了充满植物的温室和暖房。为了支持来自温暖气候的植物，1680年切尔西的植物园出现了第一批温室。到十九世纪中叶，它们的数量已经大大增加。爱丁堡皇家植物园的热带棕榈馆建于1834年；巴黎植物园包括一个墨西哥暖房，由Charles Rohault de Fleury在1834年和1836年之间建造；贝尔法斯特植物园的棕榈馆建于1839年16。后来的例子包括建于1858年的爱丁堡温差屋（图5），以及建于1874年左右的哥本哈根和佛罗伦萨的棕榈树屋。斯特拉斯堡的棕榈园建于1877年至1882年；1907年，柏林达勒姆皇家植物园的热带植物园开放，阿姆斯特丹植物园的棕榈园也在五年后完工。17 类似的发展发生在大西洋彼岸：例如，纽约植物园的温室建于1899年至1902年。

It is difficult to pinpoint the exact moment at which the botanical garden conservatory changed from being a focus for the medical and scientific professions and horticulturists to becoming a destination at which people could spend their leisure time. By the late to mid nineteenth century, however, that transformation was complete. Although several early botanical gardens - such as the one in Leyden - had been sites of education from the outset, they extended that service to the public only later. The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew gave the public access in 1841, seven years before its Palm House, designed by Decimus Burton and Richard Turner, was complete, and twenty-two years before its Temperate
House, also designed by Decimus Burton, was opened. 
**Once the conservatories in botanical gardens became destinations for public leisure, the way in which plants and flowers were arranged inside them changed. Abandoning the botanists' systematic approach, displays began to reflect the picturesque preoccupations of the eighteenth-century landscape gardeners. To add to the entertainment and level of spectacle experienced during a visit to such a conservatory, the creators of the displays sought to recreate a sense of the exotic atmosphere of the jungles in which many of the plants had originated.** The fear of the jungle was evocatively described by Jean-Baptiste Christophe Fuse Aublet, the French king's botanist. 'You have to be in a jungle to understand how dangerous it
is to enter, he explained, adding that, 'The thorny trees, the tangle of razor sharp plants ... leave the traveller fearing for his life!'

很难确定植物园温室从医学和科学专业以及园艺师的关注点转变为人们可以度过休闲时光的目的地的确切时间。然而，到19世纪末至中期，这种转变已经完成。尽管几个早期的植物园--如莱顿的植物园--从一开始就是教育场所，但它们后来才将这种服务扩展到公众。邱园的皇家植物园于1841年向公众开放，这比由Decimus Burton和Richard Turner设计的棕榈园完工早七年，比同样由Decimus Burton和Richard Turner设计的温带植物园早二十二年。
也是由Decimus Burton设计的温带馆在二十二年后开放。
**一旦植物园的温室成为公众休闲的目的地，里面的植物和花卉的布置方式就发生了变化。放弃了植物学家的系统方法，展示开始反映出18世纪景观园艺师的如画的关注点。为了增加参观此类温室时的娱乐性和观赏性，展览的创作者们试图重现丛林的异国情调，而许多植物正是来自于丛林。**法国国王的植物学家Jean-Baptiste Christophe Fuse Aublet对丛林的恐惧作了生动的描述。他解释说："你必须置身于丛林中，才能理解进入丛林有多危险。
他解释说，"带刺的树木、纠缠在一起的锋利植物......让旅行者担心自己的生命！

**By the second half of the nineteenth century, as well as visiting glasshouses in botanical gardens and commercial nurseries, people living in many towns and cities across the globe could also spend their leisure time in the numerous conservatories and palm houses that had sprung up in public parks. Funded either privately or by local municipalities, they provided a taste of exoticism that many visitors would not have been able to savour at home.** In Britain the public parks movement was a key aspect of urban development at that time, having been established to provide free public leisure spaces for the working-class populations of places adversely affected by industrialisation. In the words of Frank Clark: parks symbolised nature, affluence and health. Public parks were the answer to most of the ills of the time because of the strong belief of men like Francis Place ... that a country-like environment transplanted to the city 'can always instil a hallowed calm, and a spirit of reverence into the mind and heart of man! 

**到19世纪下半叶，除了参观植物园和商业苗圃的玻璃温室外，生活在全球许多城镇的人们还可以在<u>公共公园中兴起的</u>众多温室和棕榈树屋中度过休闲时光。由私人或地方政府出资，它们提供了一种异国情调的味道，<u>许多游客在家里是无法品尝到的。</u>**在英国，公共公园运动是当时城市发展的一个重要方面，它的建立是为了给受到工业化不利影响的地方的工人阶级提供免费的公共休闲空间。用弗兰克-克拉克的话说：公园象征着自然、富足和健康。公共公园是解决当时大多数弊病的答案，因为像Francis Place这样的人坚信......一个类似于乡村的环境被移植到城市中，"总是可以灌输一种神圣的平静，以及人的思想和心灵中的崇敬精神！"。

In 1896, a palm house was constructed in Sefton Park, Liverpool (fig. 6). It was stocked with a large collection of palms and other exotic plants, and was surrounded by sculptures by the French artist Léon-Joseph Chavalliaud, including one of Linnaeus (1900). Two sculptures by Benjamin Edward Spence, named Highland Mary (1854) and The Angel's Whisper (1857), were placed inside the building. Set in a bed of white lilies, the latter reflected the religiosity that could also be found in many of Liverpool’s private parlours. The Isla Gladstone Conservatory was built in the same city in 1899, in Stanley Park, which had opened twenty-nine years earlier. It too was stocked with a large collection of exotic plants, including palms.

**1896年，在利物浦的塞夫顿公园建造了一座棕榈树馆**（图6）。它储存了大量的棕榈树和其他外来植物，周围有法国艺术家Léon-Joseph Chavalliaud的雕塑，包括林奈的雕塑（1900）。本杰明-爱德华-斯彭斯（Benjamin Edward Spence）的两座雕塑，名为《高地玛丽》（1854）和《天使的低语》（1857），被放置在建筑内。后者镶嵌在白色百合花床上，反映了利物浦许多私人会客厅中也可以看到的宗教性。1899年，伊斯拉-格拉德斯通音乐厅在同一城市的斯坦利公园建成，它在29年前就已经开放。它也储备了大量的外来植物，包括棕榈树。

Late nineteenth-century London saw a chrysanthemum house constructed in Battersea Park, while Hackney's Victoria Park featured a palm house. Numerous European countries, as well as several other nations - South Africa, Australia and New Zealand among them - also saw palm houses and conservatories appearing in many of their public parks. In North America, likewise, buildings for plants were created in many of the new public parks. The wooden Conservatory of Flowers constructed in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park in 1879 was among the first (fig. 7). New York's Central Park, which opened to the public in 1859, also featured a conservatory, constructed in 1898, while others were opened in Chicago’s Jackson and Lincoln parks in the following decade. The populations of many other North American cities - such as Pittsburgh, Detroit and Cincinnati could also enjoy visits to the palm houses in their local parks.

十九世纪末的伦敦在巴特西公园建造了一座菊花屋，而哈克尼的维多利亚公园则有一座棕榈树屋。许多欧洲国家以及其他一些国家--南非、澳大利亚和新西兰都是如此--在他们的许多公共公园中也出现了**棕榈树屋和温室**。在北美，同样，在许多新的公共公园中也出现了植物建筑。1879年在旧金山金门公园建造的木制花卉温室是首批建筑之一（图7）。1859年向公众开放的纽约中央公园也有一个温室，建于1898年，而在接下来的十年里，芝加哥的杰克逊和林肯公园也开设了其他温室。许多其他北美城市的居民--如匹兹堡、底特律和辛辛那提--也可以享受参观当地公园的棕榈树屋。

Orangeries, frequently constructed in the **neoclassical style**, had first appeared in Renaissance Italy and had quickly spread through mainland Europe. They were the first structures to be built in the private gardens of the wealthy to support the growth of exotic fruits - oranges, pomegranates and myrtles among them.2° In Britain, the little orangery at Osterley House in London was designed by Robert Adam in around 1780, while Joseph Paxton created one at Hampton Court in 1846, five years before the construction of his Crystal Palace in Hyde Park for the 'Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations'. In Germany, an orangery was built at King Frederick the Great of Prussia's summer palace of Sanssouci, in Potsdam, in 1864 (fig. 8).

**桔园经常以新古典主义风格建造，最早出现在文艺复兴时期的意大利，并迅速传遍了欧洲大陆**。2在英国，伦敦奥斯特利宫的小桔园是由罗伯特-亚当在1780年左右设计的，而约瑟夫-帕克斯顿于1846年在汉普顿宫建造了一个桔园，比他在海德公园为 "各国工业作品大展 "建造的水晶宫早了五年。在德国，1864年普鲁士国王腓特烈大帝在波茨坦的Sanssouci夏宫建造了一个橘子园（图8）。

Orangeries were soon joined by hothouses, which utilised greater quantities of glass. Some orangeries could be transformed into glasshouses by simply replacing their slate or tile roofs with glass. Examples of very early domestic glasshouses include one made of timber and glass - more a cold frame than a greenhouse - designed by John Evelyn and illustrated in the 1691 edition of Kalendarium Hortens In 1689 a small glass case had been made for Queen Anne at Hampton Court, built by a Dutchman. Over the following century the greenhouse, as it came to be called, was to experience a number of important, technology-led changes in relation to both its heating mechanisms and its materials. In 1817 John Loudon declared that a garden was not considered complete without a greenhouse or conservatory.

**桔园很快被暖房所取代，暖房使用了更多的玻璃。**一些桔园可以通过简单地将石板或瓦片屋顶换成玻璃来改造成玻璃温室。非常早期的家用玻璃温室的例子包括一个由木材和玻璃制成的温室--与其说是温室，不如说是冷库--由约翰-伊夫林设计，并在1691年版的Kalendarium Hortens中作了说明。 1689年，一个荷兰人在汉普顿宫为安妮女王建造了一个小型玻璃柜。在接下来的一个世纪里，温室，就像它被称为的那样，在其加热机制和材料方面经历了一些重要的、由技术主导的变化。1817年，约翰-劳登宣布，没有温室或温室的花园是不完整的。

By the eighteenth century many wealthy landowners had constructed greenhouses in their private walled gardens. Gradually, however, greenhouses were integrated into flower gardens and came within sight of the house. The trend for the garden to be seen as an extension of the house was much promoted by the landscape gardener Humphry Repton. Unlike his predecessor Lancelot 'Capability' Brown, whose landscapes consisted of rolling lawns that drew the eye away from the house, Repton reintroduced formal terraces, balustrades, verandas and trellis-work in order to bring house and garden back together,25 Impressive garden conservatories were constructed in many British locations, including the grounds of Syon House, outside London, and those of Bretton Hall in West Yorkshire, both 1827. The latter was one of the first conservatories built in the curvilinear style, made possible by Loudon's invention in 1816 of a flexible wrought-iron glazing bar. Examples were also created (by Joseph Paxton) in the grounds of Chatsworth House, the seat of the Duke of Devonshire, between 1836 and 1840, and, in the same decade, at Dalkeith Park, near Edinburgh. Later in the century an Italianate curvilinear conservatory was constructed in Ramsgate in Kent (fig. 9).

到了18世纪，**许多富有的地主在他们的私人围墙花园中建造了温室。然而，渐渐地，温室被整合到花圃中，并进入了房子的视野。****园林师汉弗莱-雷普顿大力提倡将花园视为房屋的延伸。**与他的前任兰斯洛特-布朗（Lancelot 'Capability' Brown）不同，他的景观由连绵的草坪组成，将人们的视线从房子上引开，雷普顿重新引入了正式的梯田、栏杆、阳台和花架工程，以便将房子和花园重新结合起来。后者是第一批以曲线风格建造的温室之一，这是因为劳登在1816年发明了一种灵活的锻铁玻璃条。1836年至1840年间，在德文郡公爵的所在地查茨沃斯宅邸（Chatsworth House），以及同年在爱丁堡附近的达尔基斯公园（Dalkeith Park），也有这样的例子（由约瑟夫-帕克斯顿建造）。本世纪晚些时候，在肯特郡的拉姆斯盖特建造了一座意大利风格的曲线型温室（图9）。

Soon it became the norm for conservatories to be attached to houses, so that the ladies who gardened in them could avoid inclement weather. As the advice writer Shirley Hibberd explained in the 1895 edition of his book Rustic Adornments for Homes of Taste, 'We will suppose a lady to be interested in plants, and the happy possessor of a well-furnished conservatory. If it is far removed from the dwelling-house, what a deprivation of accustomed amusement will a week of snow or frost occasion!'26 In 1793, at Bellevue House in Ireland, a series of large greenhouses comprising a 650-foot-long conservatory, an orangery, a cherry house, a peach house and a vinery were attached to the main building so that Mrs Latouche, the lady of the house, could walk straight into them without risking an encounter with the elements.27 At Orton Hall in Peterborough an attached conservatory in the Tudoresque style was constructed in 1835, while a fully integrated conservatory, filled with sculpture, fountains and pillars, was added to Somerleyton Hall in Suffolk in 1843. 

**很快，温室与房屋相连就成了一种常态**，这样，在温室里种菜的女士们就可以避开恶劣的天气。正如建议作家雪莉-希伯德（Shirley Hibberd）在其1895年版的《品位之家乡村装饰》一书中所解释的那样："我们假设一位女士对植物感兴趣，并且很高兴拥有一个设施齐全的温室。26 1793年，在爱尔兰的贝尔维尤宫，一系列大型温室包括一个650英尺长的温室、一个桔园、一个樱桃园、一个桃园和一个葡萄园，这些温室与主楼相连，这样女主人拉图什夫人就可以直接走进这些温室，b而不必冒着遭遇风雨的危险。在彼得伯勒的奥顿庄园，1835年建造了一个都铎式风格的附属温室，而在萨福克的萨默莱顿庄园，1843年增加了一个完整的温室，里面有雕塑、喷泉和支柱。

Across the Atlantic in Montreal, the Shaughnessy House, constructed in 1875, contains a highly elaborate conservatory that features a patterned marble floor, engraved glass and ornamented iron pillars (fig. 10), while in the United States the fashion for extravagant domestic conservatories became a characteristic of the large houses built for wealthy members of the Gilded Age (C.1870-C.1900). Examples include William H. Vanderbilt's mansion at 640 Fifth Avenue in New York, completed in 1882; the Louis Stern-Hugo Reisinger home at 993 5th Avenue in the same city, built in 1887; and Beacon Hill House of 1909, the Newport cottage of the railroad magnate Arthur Curtiss James, in the conservatory of which Mrs James spent a great deal of time reading about flowers.28 A very particular example of American indoor landscaping could be found in Boston, in the Venetian-style museum and home of the art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner, who in 1903 created a glass-covered courtyard garden filled with palms and other tropical plants in the very heart of her building.

在大西洋彼岸的蒙特利尔，建于1875年的Shaughnessy之家有一个非常精致的温室，其特点是有花纹的大理石地板、雕刻的玻璃和装饰的铁柱（图10），而在美国，奢侈的家庭温室成为镀金时代（C.1870-1900）为富人建造的大房子的一个特点。这方面的例子包括威廉-H-范德比尔特在纽约第五大道640号的豪宅，1882年完工；路易-斯特恩-胡戈-雷辛格在同一城市第五大道993号的住宅，建于1887年；以及1909年的贝肯山庄，铁路大亨阿瑟-柯蒂斯-詹姆斯的新港别墅，詹姆斯夫人在温室里花了大量的时间阅读花卉知识。美国室内景观设计的一个非常特别的例子可以在波士顿找到，在威尼斯风格的博物馆和艺术收藏家伊莎贝拉-斯图尔特-加德纳的家中，她在1903年创造了一个玻璃覆盖的庭院花园，在她建筑的中心地带种满了棕榈树和其他热带植物。

While attached conservatories were usually linked to drawing rooms women's spaces - they were occasionally attached to morning rooms as well (fig. 11). Unusually, at The Grange in Hampshire, a conservatory was positioned opposite the lady's chambers. Both Repton and Loudon had strong views about attaching conservatories to houses. In 1816 Repton, who designed several conservatories, some with John Nash, advocated attaching them to the house in order 'to alleviate the parlour's formal gloom'29 He also advised the addition of a small aviary, or a flower passage, between the conservatory and the drawing room to avoid smells of stale earth and rotting plants coming into the house.3° Some years later Loudon explained that owning an attached conservatory was 'not indeed one of the first necessities but one which is felt to be appropriate and which mankind recognises as a mark of elegant and refined enjoyment', adding that the smell of flowers wafting into the house was a definite benefit.31 Loudon believed that women were naturally indoor people, and that the addition of an attached conservatory gave them and their daughters an engaging winter pastime.

虽然附设的温室通常与画室的女性空间相连，但偶尔也会附设于晨室（图11）。与众不同的是，在汉普郡的格兰奇（The Grange），一个暖房被安置在女士房间的对面。雷普顿和劳登都对在房屋上安装温室有强烈的意见。1816年，雷普顿设计了几个温室，其中一些是与约翰-纳什一起设计的，他主张将温室附在房子上，以 "减轻客厅的正式阴暗 "29，他还建议在温室和客厅之间增加一个小鸟笼，或一个花卉通道，以避免陈土和腐烂的植物的气味进入房子。 几年后，劳登解释说，拥有一个附属的温室 "确实不是首要的必需品之一，但它被认为是合适的，而且人类认识到它是优雅和高雅享受的标志"，并补充说，花香飘进房子是一个明确的好处。31 劳登认为，妇女是天生的室内人，增加一个附属的温室给他们和他们的女儿一个迷人的冬季消遣。

The development of sheet glass and the repeal of the tax on glass in 1845 allowed conservatories to find their way from wealthy rural homes into urban middle-class houses. The movement began in Britain (fig. 12), where Paxton's Crystal Palace acted as a model for smaller domestic versions. When the fashion for conservatories eventually reached the United States, the American advice author Henry T. Williams explained in 1872 that, 'As an ornament of architectural value, no villa is complete without them', adding, 'We find nearly all the best styles and designs ... offered only by English horticultural manufacturers."32 In 1876 Paxton launched a conservatory kit advertised as 'glasshouses for the million', thereby helping to extend the market for domestic conservatories even further. 

玻璃板的发展和1845年玻璃税的废除使得温室从富裕的农村家庭进入城市中产阶级的住宅。这一运动开始于英国（图12），帕克斯顿的水晶宫成为较小的国内版本的典范。当温室的时尚最终传到美国时，美国建议作家亨利-T-威廉姆斯在1872年解释说，"作为一种具有建筑价值的装饰品，没有温室的别墅是不完整的"，并补充说，"我们发现几乎所有最好的风格和设计......只有英国园艺制造商提供。"32 1876年，帕克斯顿推出的温室套件被宣传为 "百万玻璃温室"，从而帮助进一步扩大国内温室的市场。

**The domestication, and accompanying feminisation, of the conservatory attached to the home bestowed specific meanings on the plants within them. As had happened earlier with landscaped gardens, they were transformed from objects of scientific interest and inquiry into cultural artefacts with considerable aesthetic and symbolic value.** Exotic plant and flowers originating mostly in Australia, Africa and Asia were preferred. The much-favoured Cape heaths of the early nineteenth century were replaced a little later by cacti and orchids. The last became very fashionable and could be found suspended from the ceilings of conservatories in baskets. 'Once a luxury', Andrea Wulf has explained, they were now 'a sought-after accessory for the middle classes!33 Simultaneously, conservatories became less workspaces, and more places for leisure. Facilitated by the fact that plants were gradually removed from pots and planted directly into soil, gardeners began to emulate the practices followed in botanical gardens, and encouraged the development of picturesque interior landscapes. As Tovah Martin has evocatively expressed it, the wild beasts of horticulture were domesticated. Tropicals were tamed, potted and exhibited in idyllical)y tidy "jungle" scenes 34 Hothouse technologies continued to develop, such that by the early nineteenth century steam was being used to heat domestic conservatories. The smoke from braziers disappeared, leaving a clearer, moist atmosphere that offered a much more pleasant experience."

**附属于家庭的温室的驯化和伴随的女性化，赋予了其中的植物以特殊的意义。正如早些时候发生在景观花园中的情况一样，它们从科学兴趣和探索的对象转变为具有相当大的审美和象征价值的文化艺术品。**原产于澳大利亚、非洲和亚洲的外来植物和花卉受到青睐。**十九世纪初备受青睐的开普敦石楠，稍后被仙人掌和兰花所取代。最后一种植物变得非常时髦，可以在温室的天花板上用篮子吊起来。**安德烈-伍尔夫解释说，"它们曾经是一种奢侈品"，现在则是 "中产阶级追捧的饰品"。由于植物逐渐从花盆中取出并直接种植在土壤中，园丁们开始效仿植物园的做法，并鼓励发展如画的室内景观。正如Tovah Martin所表达的那样，园艺的野生动物被驯化了。热带植物被驯服，装入盆中，在田园诗般整洁的 "丛林 "场景中展出34 暖房技术继续发展，到19世纪初，蒸汽被用于加热家庭温室。火炉的烟雾消失了，留下了更清晰、更潮湿的气氛，提供了更愉快的体验"。

Gradually, the word'conservatory, in contrast to "glasshouse; ‘hothouse' and 'greenhouse", came to denote a space that not only was associated with plants, but also supported social interaction. A**s Henry T. Williams explained, the conservatory 'is mainly devoted to ornamental purposes,** **and the exhibition of plants in full beauty of growth and bloom**, while in the humbler greenhouse, propagating boxes are the chief furniture used by the gardener for the production and forcing of his young plants', subtly implying that the concepts of greenhouse and conservatory had gendered connotations attached to them.36 Other writers from the period encouraged the addition of fish, sculpture and seats in domestic conservatories in order to create congenial environments in which afternoon tea could be enjoyed and proposals of marriage made. 

渐渐地，"温室 "一词与 "玻璃屋；'暖房'和'温室'"形成对比，表示一个不仅与植物有关，而且还支持社会互动的空间。正如亨利-T-威廉姆斯所解释的那样，温室 "主要用于观赏目的，以及展示植物的生长和开花之美，而在更低级的温室中，繁殖箱是园丁用来生产和强迫他的年轻植物的主要家具"，巧妙地暗示温室和温室的概念具有性别化的内涵36。这一时期的其他作家鼓励在家庭温室中增加鱼类、雕塑和座椅，以便创造出可以享受下午茶和求婚的和谐环境。

A striking example of a conservatory that acted as an extension of a home could be found in Liverpool, one of Britain's most important ports, into which numerous plant-filled merchant ships arrived regularly. In 1896 the furnisher and decorator Samuel J. Waring, who was to become a partner in the British furnishing and decorating firm Waring and Gillow, bought a house in Aigburth Vale, which he called Palmyra, the name of both a type of palm and the ancient site in Syria. Waring added an octagonal-roofed conservatory, which led to a series of elaborate, intersecting glasshouses attached to the rear of his early nineteenth-century villa (fig. 13). He filled the first with exotic plants, mostly palms but also a few ferns, and added some garden furniture and a standard lamp, thus transforming it into a semi- outdoor parlour. Chinese paper lanterns hung from one of the metal beams.

利物浦是英国最重要的港口之一，许多装满植物的商船定期抵达这里，在这里可以找到一个引人注目的温室，作为住宅的延伸。1896年，家具商和装饰家塞缪尔-J-沃林（后来成为英国家具和装饰公司沃林和吉洛的合伙人）在艾格伯斯谷买了一栋房子，他把它叫做帕尔米拉，这是一种棕榈树的名字，也是叙利亚的古遗址。瓦林加建了一个八角形屋顶的温室，这使得他在19世纪初的别墅后部建起了一系列精心设计的、相互交叉的玻璃温室（图13）。他在第一个温室里种满了异国植物，大部分是棕榈树，也有一些蕨类植物，并增加了一些花园家具和一盏标准灯，从而把它变成了一个半户外会客厅。中国的纸灯笼挂在其中一根金属梁上。

As the following chapter will demonstrate, in the private sphere plants and flowers next moved from the attached conservatory into the house itself, thereby securing their integration into the very heart of Victorian middle-class domesticity. Chapter 3 will then trace the legacy of the public sphere conservatory in the emergence in the late nineteenth century of a new concept - the commercial winter garden - which, while retaining its links to horticulture, became primarily an indoor pleasure garden for the new leisure classes.

正如下一章所展示的那样，在私人领域，植物和花卉接下来从附属的温室转移到房子本身，从而确保它们融入维多利亚时代中产阶级家庭生活的核心。第三章将追溯公共领域温室的遗产，即19世纪末出现的新概念--商业冬季花园--在保留其与园艺的联系的同时，主要成为新休闲阶层的室内娱乐花园。

[Tihe culture of choice plants in the greenhouse and the window, seem[s] to me more remunerative, both intellectually and morally, than even the study of the higher departments of art, because of their suitability to all tastes, and means, and their directly educative power, for they keep us near to nature and compel us to be students of the out-door world, whence many noble inspirations and devotional impulses are drawn. Shirley Hibberd

[在我看来，在温室和橱窗里培养精选的植物，无论在智力上还是在道德上，都比研究高级艺术部门更有价值，因为它们适合所有的品味和手段，而且具有直接的教育力量，因为它们使我们接近自然，迫使我们成为户外世界的学生，许多高贵的灵感和虔诚的冲动都来自于此。雪莉-希伯德

Shirley Hibberd's words were written in 1856, at a moment when tamed nature - in the form of plants and flowers, not to mention fish in aquaria, caged birds and snakes in terraria - was moving from the attached conservatory into the urban middle-class home. Given that flowers died and plants demanded nurturing, the substantial commitment that this area of domestic life required from the nineteenth-century housewife meant that some form of compensation was clearly necessary. Hibberd and others fully understood the extent of the repayment that could be expected, and articulated it in their advice books. Plants had first made an appearance in the modern home in the Netherlands in the seventeenth century. The Dutch obsession with tulips, both as growing bulbs and as cut flowers displayed in tulipières, has been described as 'tulipomania'? Markers of wealth and social status, tulips had been so central to the Dutch economy that the tulip market's eventual collapse brought about a financial crash in the Netherlands in 1637. By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries plants had begun to enter the homes of the wealthy in Britain. At Stourhead House in Wiltshire, for instance, Thomas Chippendale Jr. created an indoor planter in the shape of an Egyptian sarcophagus for Richard Colt Hoare to use in his library.3

雪莉-希伯德的这段话写于1856年，当时驯服的自然界--以植物和花卉的形式，更不用说水族馆中的鱼、笼中的鸟和饲养的蛇--正从附属的温室进入城市的中产阶级家庭。鉴于花会死，植物需要培育，19世纪的家庭主妇需要在家庭生活的这一领域做出实质性的承诺，这意味着某种形式的补偿显然是必要的。希伯德和其他人完全了解可望得到的回报的程度，并在他们的建议书中阐明了这一点。十七世纪，植物首次在荷兰的现代家庭中出现。**荷兰人对郁金香的痴迷，无论是作为种植球茎还是作为在郁金香中展示的切花，都被描述为 "郁金香狂热症"？郁金香是财富和社会地位的标志，它在荷兰经济中的地位非常重要，以至于郁金香市场的最终崩溃导致了1637年荷兰的金融崩溃。到十八世纪末和十九世纪初，植物开始进入英国富人的家中。**例如，在威尔特郡的Stourhead House，小托马斯-奇彭代尔为理查德-科尔特-霍尔制作了一个埃及石棺形状的室内花盆，供其在图书馆使用。

By the mid-nineteenth century industrialisation had made available an increasing number of furnishing and decorative items with which women could transform their middle-class homes into havens, safely separated from the outside world in which most remunerated work was undertaken by men. Much has been written about the subtle language of the interiors of the nineteenth-century urban and suburban middle-class home, emphasising the way in which its décor expressed its inhabitants' adherence to the fast-moving fashions of the day. **Plants and flowers played an important part within that. Although plucked from the natural world, they rapidly became (near) cultural artefacts in the domestic context, extensions of the furniture and furnishings that surrounded them, and significant markers of aesthetic knowledge, or taste.** Plants and flowers softened architectural frames, lightened heavy furniture, provided decoration, elegance and refinement, acted as screens (ivy, known as the poor man's vine, was particularly important in this regard), and added colour, texture and scent. The plants that best survived gas lighting and coal fires included aspidistras, which needed little light or space, dracaenas, described as "a favorite with all fond of the plant decoration of rooms', rubber plants, some palms, robust ferns and cacti.s The possibility of including plants and flowers in decorative schemes varied according to one's wealth and access to advice. If a family was unable to afford even a small conservatory, other ways of displaying plants and flowers inside the home were available to them. They included the use of enclosed boxes hung on to the exterior of windows (fig. 14), hanging baskets in porches and window bays or on balconies and verandas, fern cases (sometimes combined with aquaria; fig. 15), small pots on windowsills and mantelpieces or in cosy corners, ivy trailing over furniture items and walls (fig. 16), plants in pots on stands, and ferns displayed in fireplaces during the summer (fig. 17). Many versions of the Wardian case were developed for the home, while a wide range of other accessories, among them free-standing pots, plant stands, jardinières, etagères, wooden troughs with lead liners, and plant cabinets also facilitated the introduction of nature into the domestic arena (fig. 18). The inhabitants of working-class homes often placed geraniums in pots on their windowsills, one of the very simplest and least expensive forms of window gardening.

到19世纪中期，工业化使越来越多的家具和装饰品成为可能，妇女可以用它们把中产阶级的家变成避难所，安全地与外部世界隔开，而外部世界的大部分有偿工作是由男人承担的。关于19世纪城市和郊区中产阶级家庭内部的微妙语言已经写了很多，强调其装饰表达了居民对当时快速变化的时尚的追随。**虽然是从自然界中摘取的，但它们迅速成为家庭环境中的（近乎）文化艺术品，是围绕它们的家具和陈设的延伸，是审美知识或品味的重要标志。**植物和花卉软化了建筑框架，减轻了沉重的家具，提供了装饰、优雅和精致，充当了屏风（常春藤，被称为穷人的藤蔓，在这方面特别重要），并增加了色彩、质地和香味。在煤气照明和煤火中存活率最高的植物包括不需要光线或空间的天南星、被称为 "所有喜欢房间植物装饰的人的最爱 "的龙爪兰、橡胶植物、一些棕榈树、强壮的蕨类植物和仙人掌。如果一个家庭连一个小型温室都买不起，他们可以用其他方式在家中展示植物和花卉。其中包括使用挂在窗户外面的封闭式箱子（图14），在门廊和窗台或阳台和阳台上的吊篮，蕨类植物箱（有时与水族箱相结合；图15），在窗台和壁炉上或舒适的角落里的小盆，在家具物品和墙壁上的常春藤（图16），支架上的盆栽，以及夏季在壁炉中展示的蕨类植物（图17）。为家庭开发了许多版本的Wardian箱子，而其他各种配件，包括独立花盆、植物架、jardinières、etagères、带铅衬里的木槽和植物柜，也促进了将自然引入家庭领域（图18）。工人阶级家庭的居民经常把天竺葵放在窗台上的花盆里，这是最简单和最便宜的窗外园艺形式之一。

While the most obvious use of domesticated plants and flowers in the nineteenth-century middle-class home was as visual components within interior décor, they also performed many other functions in that context, both practical and symbolic. The natural items displayed in nineteenth-century homes helped introduce children to the laws of science and post-Enlightenment rational thought, as well as playing a part in the self-improvement of adults. **Before the popularisation of Charles Darwin's ideas, perhaps the most important symbolic meaning of domesticated plants and flowers, however, derived from the widespread belief that nature was made by God himself and was therefore inherently 'good' As God was believed to be the creator of all things 'bright and beautiful', the beauty and goodness of indoor plants and flowers were seen as indistinguishable.** In their wild state, indigenous plants and flowers were available to everyone. Ferns could be acquired in the woods, and geraniums were easily propagated. The presence of nature in the home was also ennobling, as possessing plants, especially the non-indigenous, exotic varieties, hadhitherto been the preserve of the wealthy and the aristocratic. **Very importantly, domesticated nature was also seen as therapeutic, both in the sense that many people needed to negotiate new relationships with both the pre-industrial past and the modern industrial present and future, to which they were adapting often with some difficulty, and because living nature could act as a companion to the lonely.** The anxiety and fear excited by raw nature's power was, in the domestic context, replaced by a belief that nature had a calming effect on the soul. **Hibberd believed that nature inside was a source 'of rest, and solace, and refreshment!** Henry T. Williams, who was of the same mind, explained that indoor flowers and plants were 'soul-refreshing, heart-inspiring and eye-brightening!.? He went on to claim that plants could calm children at school, amuse invalids and even provide an object of affection for bereaved parents.& The Victorians understood the comfort that came from being reunited with nature in its tamed, domesticated form, and believed there to be a close, emotionally charged relationship between humans and plants based on their both being living organisms.

虽然驯养的植物和花卉在19世纪中产阶级家庭中最明显的用途是作为室内装饰的视觉组件，但它们在这种情况下也发挥了许多其他功能，包括实用和象征意义。**十九世纪家庭中展示的自然物品有助于向儿童介绍科学规律和启蒙运动后的理性思想，并在成年人的自我完善中发挥作用**。然而，**在查尔斯-达尔文的思想普及之前，也许驯养的植物和花卉最重要的象征意义来自于一种普遍的信念，即自然界是由上帝自己创造的，因此本质上是 "好的"。** 由于上帝被认为是所有 "明亮和美丽 "事物的创造者，室内植物和花卉的美丽和善良被认为是无法区分的。在野生状态下，本地的植物和花卉是每个人都可以得到的。蕨类植物可以在树林中获得，天竺葵也很容易繁殖。自然界在家庭中的存在也是可贵的，因为拥有植物，特别是非本地的外来品种，迄今是富人和贵族的专利。**非常重要的是，驯养的自然也被视为具有治疗作用，因为许多人需要与前工业时代和现代工业的现在和未来建立新的关系，而他们在适应这些关系时往往会遇到一些困难，也因为活着的自然可以作为孤独者的伴侣。**在家庭环境中，原始自然力量所激发的焦虑和恐惧被一种信念所取代，即自然对灵魂有镇定作用。**希伯德认为，自然界是 "休息、慰藉和提神的来源！"。**亨利-T-威廉姆斯（Henry T. Williams）也有同样的想法，他解释说，室内的花卉和植物是 "净化灵魂、鼓舞人心、使人眼睛一亮的！"。他继续宣称，植物可以安抚学校里的孩子，逗乐病人，甚至为失去亲人的父母提供一个感情的对象。

In its non-indigenous form, nature inside was also a stimulant for exotic fantasy and an escape from the domestic chores of everyday life. In addition, it represented the values of an era that was still predicated upon colonial expansion and the need for a strong sense of national identity. Plants and flowers were also believed to perform a number of utilitarian roles in the home, including producing useful gases. Anticipating ideas that were to become widespread in the early twenty-first century, G. Lister Sutcliffe explained in his 1898 book The Principles and Practice of Modern House Construction that They ... preserve the purity of the air by removing the poisonous gas evolved by animals and the combustion of hydrocarbons and maintain the equilibrium of nature!9 Given the wide range of their possible meanings and roles, plants and flowers in nineteenth-century British, continental European and North American domestic interiors were neither frivolous nor superficial decorative afterthoughts. Nor was their introduction merely a way of complementing the bric-a-brac in Victorian parlours, or of avoiding the horror vacui that so preoccupied nineteenth-century housewives. Rather, placing a dracaena in a ceramic pot on a stand in the bay window of a Victorian parlour, putting a potted Kentia palm in the corner of a dining room filled with dark wooden furniture, arranging ferns in a fireplace for the summer, trailing ivy around a door frame, or positioning a basket of chrysanthemums on the dining table constituted highly significant interventions which, whether their instigators knew it or not, touched the aesthetic, social, psychological, spiritual, moral, cultural, economic, political, scientific and technological nerves of daily life.

在其非本土的形式中，自然也是异国幻想的刺激物，是对日常生活中的家庭琐事的一种逃避。此外，它还代表了一个仍以殖民扩张和需要强烈的民族认同感为前提的时代的价值观。人们还认为植物和花卉在家庭中扮演着一些功利性的角色，包括产生有用的气体。G. Lister Sutcliffe在其1898年出版的《现代房屋建筑原理与实践》一书中解释说，它们......通过清除动物和碳氢化合物燃烧产生的有毒气体来保持空气的纯净，并维持自然界的平衡！9 鉴于植物和花卉可能具有的广泛意义和作用，19世纪英国、欧洲大陆和北美家庭室内的植物和花卉既不是轻浮的，也不是表面的装饰品。它们的引入也不仅仅是为了补充维多利亚时代客厅里的装饰品，或者是为了避免十九世纪家庭主妇们所关注的恐怖空虚。相反，在维多利亚 时代客厅的窗台上用陶瓷盆放置一株龙脑香，在摆满深色木制家具的餐厅角落里放上一盆Kentia棕榈，在壁炉里布置蕨类植物避暑，在门框上拖曳常春藤，或者在餐桌上摆放一篮子菊花，这些都是非常重要的干预措施，无论其倡导者是否知道，都触及了日常生活的审美、社会、心理、精神、道德、文化、经济、政治、科学和技术的神经。

Of all the household plants of the era, the palm was undoubtedly the most exotic. Seen as tasteful, mysterious, tropical and graceful, palms enhanced countless parlours and hallways (fig. 19). They fulfilled an important compositional role, frequently providing a frame - a set of stage side curtains, as it were - for the other interior elements. They could also act as screens, and frequently served to unify eclectic, cluttered settings. They also added height where it was needed, and the colour green to complement the widespread use of deep reds that pervaded the Victorian parlour. Many of Britain's domestic palms were supplied by the Loddiges family's Hackney Botanic Nursery, which contained the world's largest hothouse.

在那个时代的所有家用植物中，棕榈树无疑是最具异国情调的。棕榈树被视为有品位的、神秘的、热带的和优雅的，为无数的客厅和走廊增色不少（图19）。它们发挥着重要的构图作用，经常为其他室内元素提供一个框架--一套舞台侧幕，就像它一样。它们还可以充当屏风，并经常用于统一折衷的、杂乱的环境。它们还能在需要的地方增加高度，并以绿色来补充维多利亚时代客厅中广泛使用的深红色。英国的许多家用棕榈树是由洛迪格斯家族的哈克尼植物园提供的，该植物园有世界上最大的暖房。

As the century progressed, palms became increasingly visually integrated into fashionable interiors, both in wealthy country houses and in more modest urban middle-class dwellings. They introduced the exoticism of the tropics, as well as memories of empire and of an untamed world in which nature had held sway over culture. Samuel J. Waring, whose attached conservatory at his Liverpool home, Palmyra, was mentioned in Chapter 1, did not limit his interest in palms to the conservatory. He also introduced some into his dining room (fig. 20). The room in question was highly conventional in its eclecticism and historicism. It featured Chippendale-style dining chairs, French-eighteenth-century-style electric sconces, a Japanese-style bamboo fire-screen, and a neo-Tudor moulded plaster ceiling. The Turkish or Persian carpet on the floor was a sign of the fashion for orientalism that characterised many middle-class domestic interiors of the period. The addition of those three small plants, one of them positioned at the centre of the dining table, contributed to that taste of exoticism.

随着本世纪的发展，棕榈树在视觉上越来越多地融入到时尚的室内装饰中，无论是在富裕的乡村住宅还是在更适度的城市中产阶级住宅。它们引入了热带地区的异国情调，以及对帝国和未受驯服的世界的记忆，在这个世界上，自然对文化具有支配力。塞缪尔-J-沃林，他在利物浦的家--帕尔米拉的附属温室，在第一章中提到，他对棕榈树的兴趣并不限于温室。他还将一些棕榈树引入了他的餐厅（图20）。这个房间在其折衷主义和历史主义方面是非常传统的。它的特点是奇彭德尔风格的餐椅，法国十八世纪风格的电灯，日本风格的竹制火屏，以及新都铎风格的模制石膏天花板。地板上的土耳其或波斯地毯标志着东方主义的时尚，这也是当时许多中产阶级家庭室内装修的特点。这三盆小植物的加入，其中一盆放在餐桌的中央，为这种异国情调的品味做出了贡献。

Hibberd's Rustic Adornments for Homes of Taste provided a description of an 'India table decoration', the central element of which was 'a handsome feathery palm' (fig. 21).1 Tables with holes at the centre through which protruded growing palms, with their pots on the floor, also graced many dining rooms. The aim was to produce an elegant outline without obstructing the view of the guests. Several species could survive in domestic settings, among them the Kentia palm, originally from Norfolk Island in the South Pacific, which had been colonised by Captain James Cook in 1774."' In 1869 Sir Joseph Hooker, the curator of Kew's Royal Botanic Gardens, was sent some Kentia palm seeds by Charles Moore, the director of the Royal Botanic Garden in Sydney. It quickly became a favourite in wealthy British settings due to its elegance and its ability to flourish indoors. 12

Hibberd的《Rustic Adornments for Homes of Taste》描述了一种 "印度餐桌装饰"，其中心元素是 "一棵漂亮的羽毛状棕榈树"（图21）1。这样做的目的是在不妨碍客人视线的情况下产生一个优雅的轮廓。有几个物种可以在家庭环境中生存，其中有一种Kentia棕榈，最初来自南太平洋的诺福克岛，1774年詹姆斯-库克船长曾在那里定居。1869年，邱园皇家植物园的馆长约瑟夫-胡克爵士收到了悉尼皇家植物园园长查尔斯-摩尔寄来的一些Kentia棕榈种子。由于它的优雅和在室内生长的能力，它很快成为英国富人区的宠儿。12

Ferns, as well as being introduced to Britain from Jamaica, New Zealand, India, Mexico and Japan, could also be found in local woods and, though they were less robust, they offered a very cheap and accessible alternative to the potted palm.13 Like palms they had a soft profile that offset the hard woods of interiors, and the strong green of their foliage once again complemented the palette used in Victorian parlours (fig. 22). Their popularity increased with the development of a reliable method for raising them from spores. '4 The phenomenon named 'pteridomania', or fern madness, which in Britain lasted until the end of the 1860s, has been extensively documented. 15 In Britain fern-hunting was undertaken in the woods at night, while ferns could also be purchased from the Loddiges family's Hackney nursery. As well as providing elegant parlour decorations they were frequently pressed, framed and mounted onto parlour walls.

蕨类植物除了从牙买加、新西兰、印度、墨西哥和日本传入英国外，还可以在当地的树林中找到，虽然它们不太结实，但它们为盆栽棕榈提供了一个非常便宜和容易获得的替代物。13 像棕榈一样，它们有一个柔软的轮廓，抵消了室内的硬木，它们叶片的强烈绿色再次补充了维多利亚时代客厅使用的色调（图22）。随着从孢子中培养它们的可靠方法的发展，它们的受欢迎程度有所提高。4名为 "蕨类植物狂 "或蕨类植物狂的现象，在英国一直持续到19世纪60年代末，已经有了大量的记录。15 在英国，人们晚上在树林里猎取蕨类植物，而蕨类植物也可以从洛迪格斯家族的哈克尼苗圃购买。除了提供优雅的客厅装饰外，它们还经常被压制、装裱和安装在客厅的墙上。

**In both Britain and the United States, engaging in indoor plant- and flower-related activities was considered a natural extension of nineteenth-century middle-class women's participation in outdoor gardening. Horticulture and agriculture had traditionally been considered highly specialised masculine domains but, from the 1840s onwards, a close link developed between middle-class women and gardening in the domestic context.** Jane Loudon's Instructions in Gardening for Ladies was published in Britain in 1840, and was soon followed by other works. 16 Loudon's books signalled a new approach that encouraged the engagement of female novices. "7 Even so, some readers seem to have found her texts inaccessible. Across the Atlantic, in the 1844 edition of her influential book Every Lady Her Own Flower Gardener (first published in 1839), Louisa Johnson noted that her companions had asked her to write 'without Latin words and technical terms' such as Loudon employed, so that amateurs like themselves could learn how to become gardeners. 

**在英国和美国，从事室内植物和花卉相关活动被认为是19世纪中产阶级妇女参与户外园艺的自然延伸。园艺和农业传统上被认为是高度专业化的男性领域，但从19世纪40年代开始，中产阶级妇女和园艺在家庭环境中形成了密切的联系。**简-劳登的《女士园艺指南》于1840年在英国出版，并很快出版了其他作品。16 Loudon的书标志着一种鼓励女性新手参与的新方法。"7 即便如此，一些读者似乎发现她的文本难以触及。在大西洋彼岸，路易莎-约翰逊（Louisa Johnson）在她颇具影响力的《每个女人都是自己的花匠》（1839年首次出版）的1844年版本中指出，她的同伴们要求她在写作时 "不要使用卢登使用的拉丁语和技术术语"，以便像她们这样的业余爱好者能够学会如何成为园艺师。

The idea that window gardening was an amateur artistic practice undertaken by women emerged in the context of the distinction between paid work undertaken outside the home, which was seen as masculine and rational, and home-making, which was unpaid and defined as feminine, emotional, moral and, above all, aesthetic (figs 23 and 24). Women's domestic creative work in the nineteenth century, which comprised activities often referred to as 'feminine accomplishments' (for example, shell-work, hair-work, leather-work, work with moss and pine cones, Berlin wool-work, crochet and embroidery, as well as arranging plants and flowers, making floral wreaths, bouquets and table decorations, and pressing and mounting ferns and flowers), grew apace in the period, supporting the never-ending quest for domestic beauty and the social status that beauty was seen to mark. 18

窗外园艺是妇女进行的业余艺术实践的想法，是在家庭以外的有偿工作和家庭制造之间的区别中出现的，前者被视为男性和理性，而后者则是无偿的，被定义为女性的、情感的、道德的，尤其是审美的（图23和24）。十九世纪妇女的家庭创造性工作，包括通常被称为 "女性成就 "的活动（例如，贝壳工作、头发工作、皮革工作、苔藓和松果工作、柏林羊毛工作、钩织和刺绣，以及安排植物和鲜花、制作花环、花束和桌面装饰、压制和安装蕨类植物和鲜花），在这一时期迅速增长，支持对家庭美和被认为是美的标志的社会地位的无休止追求。18

Many of the symbolic meanings communicated by indoor plants and flowers, including their gendered implications, were outlined in the numerous window- (British) or parlor- (American) gardening advice books that were written between 1820 and 1900. A body of writers on both sides of the Atlantic set out to instil the necessary knowledge and skills in those new to the art of introducing plants and flowers into their interiors, and to explain the benefits to them (fig. 25). As the commercial market for such books was rapidly expanding, in the years after 1840 publishers commissioned them in increasing numbers and many new editions were printed.19 European-language texts were translated into English, and many English-language books were published on both sides of the Atlantic, often adapted appropriately for the different markets. Several American books used the same images as had been used in British publications, suggesting that publishers were collaborating closely in the expanding market and that many of the ideas were easily transferable.

室内植物和花卉所传达的许多象征性意义，包括它们的性别含义，在1820年至1900年期间编写的大量窗口（英国）或客厅（美国）园艺建议书中都有概述。在1820年至1900年期间写成。大西洋两岸的一批作家开始向那些刚开始接触将植物和花卉引入室内艺术的人灌输必要的知识和技能，并向他们解释其中的好处（图25）。由于这类书籍的商业市场正在迅速扩大，在1840年之后的几年里，出版商委托出版的书籍越来越多，而且还印刷了许多新版本。有几本美国书使用了与英国出版物相同的图像，这表明出版商在不断扩大的市场中进行了密切的合作，许多想法很容易转移。

As with all areas of advice literature, it is hard to know whether the guidance offered was actually heeded; nonetheless, the books provide an insight into the possibilities that were seen to exist.2 They covered the whole spectrum of window gardening, from planting and growing plants and flowers for indoor use, to maintaining them once inside, making and acquiring a wide range of material artefacts in which to display them, and arranging plants and cut flowers as a component of interior décor. Much advice was also provided in the numerous popular gardening and home journals that came into being in those years.? Advice books on both sides of the Atlantic broadly agreed that plants and flowers in the home represented an important form of compensation for the loss of nature experienced by the newly urbanised population. One of their most significant messages related to the assumed roles of men and women.

与所有领域的建议文献一样，我们很难知道所提供的指导是否真的被采纳；不过，这些书提供了对所存在的可能性的深入了解。2 它们涵盖了窗外园艺的整个范围，从种植和培育室内使用的植物和花卉，到在室内维护它们，制作和获得各种展示它们的材料艺术品，以及安排植物和切花作为室内装饰的组成部分。那些年出现的许多流行的园艺和家庭杂志也提供了许多建议。大西洋两岸的建议书都普遍认为，家庭中的植物和花卉是对新近城市化人口失去自然的一种重要补偿形式。它们最重要的信息之一是与男性和女性的假定角色有关。

p46

In general terms, those roles shifted as the century progressed, from a fairly equal division of labour at first - men doing the practical and horticultural activities and women undertaking flower arranging and introducing plants and flowers into their interior decorative schemes - to a situation that saw women taking on a greater share of the work.

一般来说，随着本世纪的进展，这些角色发生了变化，从最初相当平等的分工--男性从事实际和园艺活动，女性从事插花并将植物和花卉引入室内装饰方案--到现在女性承担了更多的工作。

In Britain, early advice on how to look after plants in pots was provided by Elizabeth Kent and Leigh Hunt in their 1823 book Flora Domestica; or, the Portable Flower Garden, in which the authors showed an early awareness of the tension between the scientific field of botany and the art of arranging plants and flowers. Thirty-three years later, Hibberd claimed that, **in the form of domesticated plants and flowers, the world of nature provided a metaphor for the highest achievements of human nature itself and offset the 'commotion and dust' that otherwise dominated life in an urban setting.**22 His Rustic Adornments for Homes of Taste (first published in 1856 but reprinted in 1857, 1870 and 1895) was among the first British books to address the subject of window gardening that reached a large audience.23 Its main emphasis was on the construction of what the author called 'toys' for the home, fish tanks, bird-houses, bee-houses and plant cases among them. Most of the 1856 and 1857 texts dealt with aquaria, aviaries, apiaries and the exterior garden, while only three small sections of the book. entitled 'The Wardian Case' 'The Waltonian Case' and 'Floral Ornaments for the Table and Window' were dedicated to the inclusion of plants and flowers in interiors. While the first two of these - clearly directed at a male reader - detailed the construction of different kinds of cases and the technicalities of growing plants in them, the third addressed a female audience. Readers were therefore led to believe that, in the 1850s, window gardening involved a gendered division of labour.

在英国，关于如何照顾盆栽的早期建议是由伊丽莎白-肯特和利-亨特在1823年出版的《家庭花卉》（Flora Domestica; or, the Portable Flower Garden）一书中提供的，其中作者很早就意识到植物学的科学领域与摆放植物和花卉的艺术之间存在着矛盾。33年后，希伯德声称，通过驯化植物和花卉的形式，自然界为人类自然本身的最高成就提供了一个隐喻，并抵消了城市环境中主导生活的 "骚动和灰尘"。他的Rustic Adornments for Homes of Taste（1856年首次出版，1857年、1870年和1895年重印）是英国第一批涉及窗外园艺主题的书籍，读者众多。23 其主要重点是建造作者所谓的家庭 "玩具"，其中包括鱼缸、鸟巢、蜂巢和植物箱。1856年和1857年的大部分文章都涉及水族馆、鸟舍、养蜂室和外部花园，而该书中只有三个小部分，即 "Wardian案例"、"Waltonian案例 "和 "桌子和窗户的花饰"，是专门讨论室内植物和花卉的。其中前两篇--显然是针对男性读者的--详细介绍了不同种类的箱子的构造以及在其中种植植物的技术问题，而第三篇则是针对女性读者的。因此，读者们相信，在19世纪50年代，窗外园艺涉及性别分工。

In his introduction, 'The Home of Taste', Hibberd ensured that his female readers did not feel excluded by acknowledging that he believed indoor gardening to be an art form. He spoke of the 'union of Nature and Art', and in the preface he used the terms 'domestic aesthetics' and 'domestic elegance', which he believed to have existed in middle-class society for around twenty years.24 Hibberd's emphasis on taste, and the link between window gardening and other artistic practices, singled him out from other writers on the subject. 'No matter in what form', he wrote, "the cultivation of Taste may manifest itself, in paintings and sculptures, in the analysis of scenery, in the grouping of flowers, in the embellishment of the window or the mantel ... refinement of manners, kindliness of feelings and a deeper devotion will be its sure attendants'25 **Hibberd was undoubtedly conscious of the special relationship between women and plants and, when it came to the subject of decorating and arranging the latter, he addressed a female audience directly, exhorting his readers to 'adorn your table ... with flowers out of the fields!26**

在他的序言 "品味之家 "中，希伯德承认他认为室内园艺是一种艺术形式，从而确保了他的女性读者不会感到被排斥。他谈到了 "自然与艺术的结合"，并在序言中使用了 "家庭美学 "和 "家庭优雅 "这两个词，他认为这两个词在中产阶级社会已经存在了大约20年。24 希伯德对品味的强调，以及窗外园艺与其他艺术实践之间的联系，使他从这个主题的其他作家中脱颖而出。他写道："无论以何种形式，品味的培养都可能体现在绘画和雕塑中，体现在对风景的分析中，体现在花卉的组合中，体现在窗户或壁炉的点缀中......。25 **希伯德无疑意识到了妇女和植物之间的特殊关系，当谈到装饰和布置植物的主题时，他直接向女性读者发表了讲话，劝告他的读者 "用田野里的鲜花......装饰你的餐桌！26**

Across the Atlantic, Henry T. Williams's book Window Gardening was first published in 1862 in New York. Later editions followed in 1872 and 1876. It owed much to Hibberd's text, with the emphasis in the first two sections being on toys, the categorisation of plants, and the practicalities of growing plants indoors, including how to keep insects at bay. The concept of taste was mentioned only in passing, however, and ladies were included only briefly in their capacity as natural nurturers. Williams noted at one point that it was 'easy for many [a] lady to raise her own verbenas'27 He also included an engraved image of a conservatory featuring a female gardener and made a reference to Miss Maling - a well-known advice writer herself, as well as an inventor - crediting her with the design of a large fern case.28 In the third section of the book, entitled 'Parlor Decorations', women were, predictably, addressed more overtly.z9 Williams openly acknowledged that women had been very successful in that area. 'The amateurs [i.e., women] have outstripped the professionals in the rapidity of their progress', he wrote, adding that 'the prettiest rooms today are embellished by the fingers of a fair plant lover, who a year ago did not know one flower from another! There was an implication in Williams's text that parlour decorating required more engagement and activity than many other forms of women's creative work in the home, presumably because some knowledge of floriculture was required.

在大西洋彼岸，Henry T. Williams的《窗外园艺》一书于1862年在纽约首次出版。后来的版本在1872年和1876年出版。该书在很大程度上归功于希伯德的文本，前两节的重点是玩具、植物的分类以及在室内种植植物的实用性，包括如何防止昆虫的侵入。然而，品味的概念只是被顺便提及，而女士们作为自然养育者的身份也只是被简要地包括在内。威廉斯有一次指出，"对许多[女士]来说，养活自己的马鞭草是很容易的 "27，他还附上了一张以女园丁为主角的温室雕刻图片，并提到了马林小姐--她本身就是一位著名的建议作家，同时也是一位发明家--将一个大型蕨类植物箱的设计归功于她28。他写道："业余爱好者[即妇女]的进步速度已经超过了专业人员"，并补充说："今天最漂亮的房间是由一个美丽的植物爱好者的手指点缀的，而一年前她还不知道有哪种花呢！"。威廉姆斯的文章中暗示，与许多其他形式的妇女在家中的创造性工作相比，客厅装饰需要更多的参与和活动，这可能是因为需要一些花卉栽培的知识。

Two books relating exclusively to the subject of cut-flower arranging were published in 1862. One was written by Mr Thomas March, who had won first prize at the first Royal Horticultural Society show of 1861 for the design of what, predictably, came to be called a 'March stand'3 March's book of the following year, Flower and Fruit Decoration, which looked back to the era of the country house, told (male) gardeners which kinds of vases and soil to use. The target audience throughout his short text was the male tradesman who supplied the materials and flowers for table decorations in wealthy households. John Perkins - from 1848 the gardener to the Henniker family at Thornton Hall, Suffolk - adopted the same approach in his 1877 book, Floral Decorations for the Table. Like March, Perkins remained entrenched in an earlier era in which male gardeners had held sway, and largely ignored the way in which middle-class ladies were taking over the art of table decoration.31

1862年出版了两本专门介绍切花插花的书。其中一本是由托马斯-马奇先生撰写的，他曾在1861年的第一届皇家园艺协会展会上获得一等奖，可以预见的是，他的设计被称为 "马奇展台"。他的短文的目标读者是那些为富裕家庭的餐桌装饰提供材料和鲜花的男性商人。约翰-珀金斯--从1848年起担任萨福克郡桑顿庄园亨尼克家族的园丁--在其1877年出版的《餐桌花艺装饰》一书中采用了同样的方法。与马奇一样，珀金斯仍然固守在男性园丁占据主导地位的早期时代，在很大程度上忽略了中产阶级女性接管餐桌装饰艺术的方式。

Miss A. E. Maling's book Flowers for Ornament and Decoration was published in the same year as March's. The author acknowledged that the facet of indoor gardening she was describing was of interest to women only.32 She covered a wide range of floral ornaments, from knots of flowers to wear on dresses, to bouquets, wreaths, and flowers in vases and hanging baskets. There can be no question about Maling's strong belief in the artistic status of flower arranging and in its being one of women's domestic accomplishments. As we have already seen, Maling was an inventor as well as a flower arranger and she won prizes for, among other designs, her invention of a fern case that could be either heated or cooled as required. In her determination to reach a female audience, Maling made frequent references to the links between flower arranging and dress. 'It is doubtless most desirable', she wrote, 'that flowers should suit the general colour and style of the dress and ribbons with which they are to be worn '33

A.E.Maling小姐的《装饰用花》与March的书同年出版。作者承认，她所描述的室内园艺方面只有妇女感兴趣。32 她涵盖了广泛的花饰，从穿在衣服上的花结，到花束、花环，以及花瓶和吊篮中的花。毫无疑问，马林坚信插花的艺术地位，坚信插花是妇女的家庭成就之一。正如我们已经看到的，马林既是一个发明家，也是一个插花者，她因发明了一种可以根据需要加热或冷却的蕨类植物箱而获奖。在决心接触女性观众时，马林经常提到插花和服装之间的联系。她写道："毫无疑问，最理想的是，鲜花应该适合与之搭配的衣服和丝带的一般颜色和风格 "33。

Annie Hassard, the author of Floral Decorations for the Dwelling House: A Practical Guide for the Home Arrangement of Plants and Flowers, published in 1875, extended Maling's approach to yet another generation of British middle-class female home-makers, and this time included plants as well as cut flowers. By this date amateur women were competing openlv with professional men in the numerous flower-arranging competitions that were taking place around the country. Although overtly 'Intended for the use of Ladies and Amateurs', Hassard's book offers a very detailed account, both practically and artistically oriented, of the best plants and best pieces of equipment to use for a wide variety of indoor plant and flower decorations, from bouquets to dining tables, window displays hanging baskets and Christmas decorations, as well as giving advice on how best to arrange them. The following year saw an American edition of Hassard's book published by Macmillan. Adapted for that market, this edition put even more emphasis on plants and flowers as part of the interior decorating schemes used in parlours and dining rooms.

安妮-哈萨德是《住宅花艺装饰》的作者。1875年出版的《家庭植物和花卉布置实用指南》将马林的方法推广到另一代英国中产阶级女性家庭主妇，这次包括了植物和切花。到这一天，业余妇女已经在全国各地举行的众多插花比赛中与专业男子公开竞争。虽然公开表示 "供女士和业余爱好者使用"，但哈萨德的书提供了非常详细的说明，既有实用性也有艺术性，介绍了用于各种室内植物和花卉装饰的最佳植物和最佳设备，从花束到餐桌、橱窗展示、吊篮和圣诞装饰，并就如何最好地安排它们提供了建议。次年，哈萨德的书由麦克米伦出版了美国版。该版本针对该市场进行了调整，更加强调植物和花卉作为客厅和餐厅室内装饰方案的一部分。

In a later book, The New Practical Window Gardener, originally published in 1877, the British writer John R. Mollinson also focused on the construction of window gardening equipment, from window boxes to window greenhouses, with a male audience in mind. Towards the end of the book, however, his way of addressing the subject of floral decoration in the home was to let Annie Hassard speak on his behalf. In so doing, Mollinson was bowing to what he believed to be women's superior capacity for flower arranging. He was also showing that, while he was comfortable providing such practical tips as 'pot plants arranged in zinc pans and flower stands should always be provided with flats to stand in, he clearly felt less qualified to write about taste. 34 Like Williams before him, he openly admitted that 'Ladies with their nimble fingers and quick fancies are always the best at floral decorations in the dwelling. This is as it should be.'35

在后来出版的《新实用窗边园丁》（The New Practical Window Gardener）一书中，英国作家约翰-R-莫林森（John R. Mollinson）也重点介绍了窗边园艺设备的建造，从窗边箱到窗边温室，他考虑的是男性读者。然而，在书的结尾处，他处理家庭花卉装饰问题的方式是让安妮-哈萨德代表他发言。这样一来，莫林森就向他认为的女性在插花方面的卓越能力低头了。他还表明，虽然他能够自如地提供一些实用的建议，如 "在锌锅中摆放盆栽，花架应始终提供平坦的位置，但他显然觉得没有资格写品味。34 像之前的威廉姆斯一样，他公开承认，"女士们以其灵活的手指和快速的想象力，总是最擅长住宅中的花草装饰。这也是应该的。"35

There was a tendency for female writers to focus more, albeit not exclusively, on flowers and flower arranging than on growing plants. That fitted with the prevailing idea that any self-respecting lady should know all the old-fashioned flowers and understand the language of flowers. By the 1880s, Japan was having a very strong influence on what had become a very specific art form.36 As Charles F. Warner explained in 1910:

If we have learnt much from the Japanese in regard to the arrangement and hanging of pictures, from them we have learnt more about the artistic arrangement of flowers. They have taught us to value the stem and leaves of the flower as essential to an artistic arrangement, that flowers of the same kind should be grouped together, and that harmony and blending of colour are necessary to secure the most artistic effects. 37

女性作家有一种倾向，即更多地（尽管不是全部）关注花卉和插花，而不是种植植物。这符合当时流行的观点，即任何有自尊心的女士都应该了解所有老式的花卉，并理解花卉的语言。到19世纪80年代，日本对已经成为一种非常特殊的艺术形式产生了非常大的影响。

如果说我们从日本人那里学到了很多关于图片布置和悬挂的知识，那么我们从他们那里学到了更多关于鲜花的艺术布置。他们教会我们重视花的茎和叶，认为这是艺术安排的关键，同类的花应该组合在一起，和谐和混合的颜色是确保最艺术的效果。37

The last years of the century saw the emergence of a male-dominated campaign against flowers. While flowers were seen as being overtly sexual, foliage was considered tasteful and chaste, and was said to call forth higher emotions.38 A wedge was thus driven between plants and flowers that continued into the twentieth century, such that the cultures of household plants and flower arranging followed increasingly independent routes. While flower arranging remained within the realm of interior decoration, both amateur and professional, and was linked almost exclusively to female practitioners and the domestic sphere, household plants moved into the public arena, where the scale of operations became much larger and more overtly commercial.

在本世纪的最后几年，出现了一场以男性为主的反对花卉的运动。花卉被认为是公开的性行为，而叶子则被认为是有品位的和贞洁的，据说可以唤起更高的情感。38 因此，植物和花卉之间出现了一个楔子，这个楔子一直持续到20世纪，因此家庭植物和插花的文化遵循越来越独立的路线。插花仍然属于室内装饰的范畴，包括业余的和专业的，而且几乎只与女性从业者和家庭领域有关，而家用植物则进入了公共领域，其经营规模变得更大，而且更加公开化。

By the turn of the century there was a strong sense that the values communicated by indoor plants and flowers in the early to mid-century, especially their links to science, education, spirituality, godliness and morality, had become overshadowed by their secular, aesthetic role in the fashionable domestic interior. Less and less was written about plants' religious and therapeutic functions. With that shift, nature inside became instrumentalised in the commercial arena. While the spread of indoor nature beyond the domestic sphere considerably eased the tensions associated with people's exit from the home and entrance into the world of commerce and public leisure, it also benefited the entrepreneurs, who were eager to take financial advantage of the benefits that nature inside had to offer.

到了世纪之交，人们强烈地感觉到，在本世纪初至中期，室内植物和花卉所传达的价值，特别是它们与科学、教育、灵性、虔诚和道德的联系，已经被它们在时尚的家庭室内的世俗、审美作用所掩盖了。关于植物的宗教和治疗功能的文章越来越少。随着这种转变，室内的自然界在商业领域中变得很有作用。虽然室内自然的传播超出了家庭范围，大大缓解了与人们离开家庭、进入商业和公共休闲世界有关的紧张关系，但它也使企业家受益，他们急于从室内自然所提供的好处中获得经济利益。

Are plants sought, discovered, researched, propagated, bred, bought and sold for the benefit of plants or to satisfy the interests of people?' Charles A. Lewis

寻找、发现、研究、繁殖、培育、购买和销售植物是为了植物的利益还是为了满足人们的利益？

Through the second half of the nineteenth century tamed plants and flowers were introduced into numerous new, urban, public and semi-public inside spaces across the Western world, many of them defined by their links to commerce. **In those new settings, the traditional values and meanings that plants and flowers had communicated in the domestic sphere were joined by new ones linked to fashion, conspicuous leisure, pleasure, consumption and democratised luxury, in short, to the range of activities that defined the experience of urban modernity in the public sphere from 1850 to 1914.2 The presence of plants and flowers in those spaces (or in some instances the mere memory of them) helped visitors feel sufficiently at home to want to engage in consumption.**

在19世纪下半叶，被驯服的植物和花卉被引入整个西方世界的许多新的、城市的、公共的和半公共的内部空间，其中许多是由它们与商业的联系决定的。**在这些新的环境中，植物和花卉在家庭领域传达的传统价值和意义被与时尚、显眼的休闲、快乐、消费和民主化的奢侈联系起来，总之，与1850年至1914年在公共领域定义城市现代性体验的一系列活动联系起来。**

In the public arena plants and flowers moved beyond the conservatories in botanical gardens and the palm houses in local parks into the inside spaces of urban and seaside winter gardens, exhibition buildings, leisure complexes and museums, and into the palm courts located within the semi-public inside spaces of grand hotels, ocean liners and department stores. From the seventeenth century onwards, glasshouses containing tropical plants had been looked upon as Gardens of Eden, or as little Paradises on earth.3 Although now linked to commercial values, that vision continued to be associated with the new indoor public spaces of the nineteenth century.

在公共领域，植物和花卉超越了植物园的温室和地方公园的棕榈屋，进入了城市和海滨冬季花园、展览建筑、休闲场所和博物馆的内部空间，以及位于大酒店、远洋轮船和百货商店的半公共内部空间的棕榈球场。从十七世纪开始，种植热带植物的玻璃温室就被视为伊甸园，或者说是地球上的小天堂。3 虽然现在与商业价值有关，但这种观点仍然与十九世纪的新室内公共空间有关。

Many public winter gardens were built in the second half of the nineteenth century. While they recalled the elaborate eighteenth-century orangeries and glasshouses constructed by the aristocracy on their extensive estates, and though they often contained plants, these were primarily social spaces. They did impart some knowledge of the natural world to their middle- and working-class visitors, many of whom were new to the experience of public leisure, but, more importantly, they helped transfer into the public arena the social interactions that had hitherto taken place in the domestic sphere. As a result, sitting, dining, socialising, parading and shopping in an indoor public environment containing exotic plants and flowers became a possibility for increasing numbers of people.

**许多公共冬季花园是在19世纪下半叶建造的**。虽然它们让人想起十八世纪贵族们在他们广阔的庄园里建造的精致的橘子园和玻璃房，虽然它们经常有植物，但这些主要是社会空间。它**们确实向中产阶级和工人阶级的参观者传授了一些自然界的知识**，其中许多人是第一次体验公共休闲，但更重要的是，它们有助于将迄今为止**发生在家庭领域的社会互动转移到公共舞台上**。因此，对越来越多的人来说，在一个有异国植物和花卉的室内公共环境中坐着、吃饭、社交、游行和购物成为一种可能。

As leisure became democratised, the need for enclosed spaces in which public entertainment could take place increased. In eighteenth-century London the aristocracy had visited open-air pleasure gardens. Following the closure of the fashionable Vauxhall Gardens in 1859, Cremorne Gardens in Chelsea (fig. 26) became a very popular venue until its closure in 1877.1 As well as lawns, groves and flower beds it contained a number of enclosed spaces, including kiosks, dance floors, refreshment rooms and its own iron- and-glass building, Ashburnham Pavilion, which was constructed in 1858.5 The increasing need for covered leisure spaces converged with a growth in the supply of plants and flowers that could be used indoors. 

随着休闲的民主化，人们对可以进行公共娱乐的封闭空间的需求也在增加。在18世纪的伦敦，贵族们曾参观过露天的娱乐花园。在时尚的沃克斯豪尔花园于1859年关闭后，切尔西的克里莫恩花园（图26）成为一个非常受欢迎的场所，直到1877年关闭。

Several public winter gardens combining horticultural and social functions had already appeared in continental Europe in the early nineteenth century. In his Encyclopedia of Gardening of 1850 John Loudon described one example, located in Berlin. Stefan Koppelkamm has explained that Loudon may have seen the Berlin winter garden on his first visit to Europe in 1813-14, when he also saw others in Strasbourg, Potsdam and Vienna. Loudon described the Berlin building as 'stone-built with a solid roof and filled in winter with scented bulbs such as hyacinths and narcissi, plus heaths and acacias!" According to Loudon it also contained a number of botanical novelties, including oranges and myrtles - the luxuries of the eighteenth century.

十九世纪初，欧洲大陆已经出现了几个结合园艺和社会功能的公共冬季花园。约翰-劳登在他1850年的《园艺百科全书》中描述了一个位于柏林的例子。Stefan Koppelkamm解释说，劳登可能是在1813-14年首次访问欧洲时看到了柏林的冬季花园，当时他还在斯特拉斯堡、波茨坦和维也纳看到了其他的冬季花园。劳登描述说，柏林的建筑是 "用石头建造的，有一个坚固的屋顶，在冬天种满了风信子和水仙等香味的球茎，还有石楠和刺槐！" 据劳登说，它还包含一些植物学上的新东西，包括橙子和桃金娘--十八世纪的奢侈品。

p53

Although, at that early date, the exotic plants in the Berlin winter garden were undoubtedly its primary attraction, other activities went on in it as well. According to Loudon, it was also a place for promenading and for seeing and being seen. He explained that 'It is almost needless to say that in these gardens there are plenty of seats and small moveable tables; there are also, generally, bands of music, a reciter of poetry, a reader, a lecturer or some other person or party to supply vocal or intellectual entertainment.9 Trunks of trees grew out of the middle of round tables, and billiard tables were provided for ladies, while the gentlemen read newspapers, took chocolate and talked politics.

尽管在早期，柏林冬季花园中的异国植物无疑是其主要吸引力。虽然在早期，柏林冬季花园的奇异植物无疑是其主要的吸引力，但其他活动也在其中进行 其他活动也在其中进行。根据劳登的说法，它也是一个散步的地方 和观赏与被观赏的地方。他解释说，"几乎不用说 几乎不用说，在这些花园里有大量的座位和可移动的小桌子。桌子；一般来说，还有音乐乐队、诗歌朗诵者。读者、演讲者或其他一些人或团体提供声乐或智力方面的娱乐。9 树干从圆桌中间长出来，台球桌也是如此。圆桌中间长出了树干，为女士们提供了台球桌，而先生们则阅读报纸、吃巧克力和聊天。先生们阅读报纸，吃巧克力，谈论政治。

The first conservatory in the Jardin d'Hiver in Paris was pulled down in 1846 and a new one opened two years later. As well as featuring 'promenades, a jardin anglais complete with a lawn and several fountains' and providing a feast for the senses, the 'air [being) filled with the scent of orange blossom and the song of birds;, the new Parisian winter garden also contained an indoor ballroom, a café and a reading room. "° However, as the appeal of indoor exotic plants was still new in France, the main focus remained on the garden. " Joseph Paxton attended a concert at the garden in its opening year and apparently admired the interior landscape he encountered there.

巴黎冬日花园的第一个温室于1846年被拆除，两年后新的温室落成。除了具有 "长廊、一个带有草坪和几个喷泉的天使花园 "和提供感官盛宴，"空气中充满了橙花的香味和鸟儿的歌声；新的巴黎冬季花园还包括一个室内舞厅、一个咖啡馆和一个阅览室。"然而，由于室内异国植物的吸引力在法国仍是新事物，主要的焦点仍然是花园。"约瑟夫-帕克斯顿在花园开放的那一年参加了一场音乐会，显然他很欣赏在那里遇到的室内景观。

Britain's first large public winter garden opened in 1844, on land in Regent's Park which had previously been owned by Jenkin's nursery. it was designed by Decimus Burton and Richard Turner, and run by the Royal Botanic Society, which had been formed in 1839. The London winter garden was reserved for an educated public. As well as housing plants, it contained a lecture hall, a library and a museum, and it was used for lectures and meetings as well as for flower shows and social gatherings. Queen Victoria was the garden's first patroness and seems to have taken a great interest in it, encouraging ladies to become members. 12

英国第一个大型公共冬季花园于1844年开放，位于摄政公园的土地上，该土地以前属于詹金苗圃。它由德西莫斯-伯顿和理查德-特纳设计，由1839年成立的皇家植物学会管理。伦敦冬季花园是为受过教育的公众保留的。除了种植植物外，它还包括一个演讲厅、一个图书馆和一个博物馆，它被用于演讲和会议，以及花展和社交聚会。维多利亚女王是该花园的第一位女赞助人，她似乎对它非常感兴趣，鼓励女士们成为会员。12

By the end of the nineteenth century, the term 'winter garden' had come to describe a spectrum of buildings: those containing plants, which could also be used for social purposes, and more hybrid leisure and entertainment complexes, which, while frequently containing plants, prioritised other functions. As the nature of urban social activities was changing at an unprecedented rate, and people were experiencing a traumatic break from much of what they had previously known, the presence of plants and flowers in those public leisure spaces maintained an important link to the past. The fact that they were phased out quite slowly minimised the shock that might otherwise have been felt. Indoor plants in public winter gardens played a transitional role, therefore, easing the path to the development of mass leisure spaces in urban settings.

到19世纪末，"冬季花园 "一词已被用来描述一系列建筑：那些包含植物的建筑，也可用于社会目的，以及更多的混合型休闲和娱乐综合体，虽然经常包含植物，但优先考虑了其他功能。由于城市社会活动的性质正以前所未有的速度发生变化，人们正经历着与他们以前所知道的许多东西相分离的创伤，植物和花卉在这些公共休闲空间的存在保持着与过去的重要联系。它们被慢慢淘汰的事实使人们可能感受到的震惊降到了最低。因此，公共冬季花园中的室内植物发挥了过渡性作用，为城市环境中的大众休闲空间的发展铺平了道路。

The best-documented English example from the middle years of the nineteenth century is the Crystal Palace (fig. 27), which was designed by Paxton to house the Great Exhibition of 1851 in Hyde Park. It is often seen as one of the first international public buildings to be made from cast iron and glass, and was designed to act as a container for manufactured commodities and to engage the public in a modern experience that was a mix of education and entertainment. Paxton based the Hyde Park structure on his designs for greenhouses in the grounds of the home of the 6th Duke of Devonshire, Chatsworth House, between 1836 and 1840. Prince Albert and Henry Cole (a member of the Commission responsible for mounting the event) wanted the Great Exhibition to contain a display of manufactured products as a means of promoting international trade, and, in sponsoring the creation of the Palace, they set in train a trajectory that saw iron-and- glass buildings being used, later in the century and beyond, for exhibition halls worldwide. '3 The Crystal Palace was also strongly reminiscent of the horticultural glasshouse, however: '4 In addition, numerous elms were left on the site, a condition of the Palace's being constructed in Hyde Park, while other trees were brought in to create a winter garden inside the building. When Paxton rebuilt his Crystal Palace in Sydenham in 1854 (fig. 28), the new iron-and-glass construction returned more closely to its origins as a glasshouse, housing, among other plants, a vast collection of exotics that he had bought from the Loddiges family's nursery when it closed in the 1850S. 15

十九世纪中叶有据可查的英国例子是水晶宫（图27），它是帕克斯顿为1851年在海德公园举办的大展而设计的。它通常被看作是第一批用铸铁和玻璃制成的国际公共建筑之一，其设计目的是作为制造商品的容器，让公众参与到教育和娱乐相结合的现代体验中。帕克斯顿根据他在1836年至1840年期间为第六代德文郡公爵的住宅查茨沃斯庄园的温室设计的结构，建造了海德公园。阿尔伯特亲王和亨利-科尔（负责筹办活动的委员会成员）希望大展包含制成品的展示，作为促进国际贸易的一种手段，在赞助水晶宫的创建过程中，他们开启了一条轨迹，在本世纪后期及以后，铁和玻璃建筑被用于世界各地的展览厅。然而，水晶宫也让人强烈地联想到园艺用的玻璃房："4此外，许多榆树被留在了现场，这是水晶宫在海德公园建造的条件，而其他树木则被运进来，在建筑内创造一个冬季花园。1854年，帕克斯顿在Sydenham重建了他的水晶宫（图28），新的铁和玻璃结构更接近于它作为玻璃温室的起源，除其他植物外，他还收藏了大量的外来植物，这些植物是他在1850年代从Loddiges家族的苗圃关闭时购买的。15

The Crystal Palace provided a model for a wide variety of subsequent iron-and-glass buildings, which included museums, exhibition halls, public leisure centres and department stores. While many arcades, marketplaces and railway stations also owed their design to the Crystal Palace, they rarely contained trees, plants or flowers. However, arguably, through their use of iron and glass they too evoked memories of the plant-filled glasshouse. Following the establishment of the original Sunderland Museum in 1846, a new one was built in 1879 next to Mowbray Park. Based on the Crystal Palace, it included a library and a winter garden with plants. Many others were built in other parts of the world. New York constructed its own Crystal Palace in 1853. In 1887 another example was built in the Jardines del Retro in Madrid for the Exposition of the Philippines. Other large world exhibitions housed in similar iron-and-glass buildings included the 1862 event held in London's South Kensington and the Vienna International Exhibition of 1873. The latter featured an enormous rotunda. The ambitious Centennial Exhibition held in Philadelphia in 1876 showed its exhibits in several separate buildings, most of which used iron and glass in their construction. The 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle included an iron-and- glass Horticultural Hall that was filled with plants and flowers.

水晶宫为后来各种各样的铁玻璃建筑提供了一个模型，其中包括博物馆、展览馆、公共休闲中心和百货商店。虽然许多拱廊、市场和火车站的设计也得益于水晶宫，但它们很少有树木、植物或鲜花。然而，可以说，通过对铁和玻璃的使用，它们也唤起了人们对充满植物的玻璃房的记忆。继1846年建立最初的桑德兰博物馆后，1879年在莫布雷公园旁边建立了一个新的博物馆。它以水晶宫为基础，包括一个图书馆和一个装有植物的冬季花园。世界其他地方也建造了许多其他的博物馆。1853年，纽约建造了自己的水晶宫。1887年，另一个例子是在马德里的Jardines del Retro为菲律宾博览会建造的。在类似的铁和玻璃建筑中举办的其他大型世界博览会包括1862年在伦敦南肯辛顿举行的活动和1873年的维也纳国际博览会。后者有一个巨大的圆形大厅。1876年在费城举行的雄心勃勃的百年博览会在几个独立的建筑中展示了其展品，其中大部分建筑都使用了铁和玻璃。1900年的巴黎世界博览会包括一个铁和玻璃的园艺厅，里面摆满了植物和鲜花。

A number of the new educational and leisure centres that emerged in London from 1870 onwards also contained winter gardens modelled on the Crystal Palace, among them the Alexandra Palace in Muswell Hill, which opened in 1873 but was destroyed by a fire and reopened in 1875; the Royal Aquarium and Summer and Winter Gardens in Westminster, opened in 1876; and the People's Palace on the Mile End Road, opened in 1886. These enclosed structures sheltered visitors as they performed their new social identities in public. Based on the conservatories in botanical gardens and public parks, they were run commercially. As a result, while the utopianism associated with the horticultural glasshouse persevered, the plants and flowers in those buildings also acted as commercial props.

从1870年起，伦敦出现的一些新的教育和休闲中心也有仿照水晶宫建造的冬季花园，其中包括位于马斯威尔山的亚历山德拉宫，它于1873年开放，但被一场大火烧毁，1875年重新开放；位于威斯敏斯特的皇家水族馆和夏季及冬季花园，于1876年开放；以及位于Mile End路上的人民宫，于1886年开放。这些封闭的建筑为游客提供了庇护，因为他们在公众面前表现出了他们新的社会身份。在植物园和公共公园的温室的基础上，它们被商业化运作。因此，虽然与园艺玻璃房相关的乌托邦主义持续存在，但这些建筑中的植物和花卉也充当了商业道具。

The Royal Aquarium and Summer and Winter Gardens (fig. 29), a stone-and-brick entertainment complex, had a great hall covered with a barrel-vaulted roof of cast iron and glass, and contained palm trees, fountains,sculptures, thirteen large fish tanks and an orchestra. 16 Around the hall were rooms for eating, smoking, reading and playing chess, an art gallery, a skating rink and a theatre. A private enterprise - its original board of directors included the theatrical manager Wybrow Robertson and the retailer William Whitely - the Aquarium was intended to be a centrally located Crystal Palace. However, it was also meant to serve as an enclosed pleasure garden, replacing Cremorne Gardens.

皇家水族馆和夏季及冬季花园（图29）是一个石砖结构的娱乐场所，有一个大殿，上面有铸铁和玻璃的桶状拱顶，里面有棕榈树、喷泉、雕塑、13个大鱼缸和一个管弦乐队。大厅周围有吃饭、抽烟、阅读和下棋的房间，还有一个艺术馆、一个溜冰场和一个剧院。水族馆是一家私营企业--其最初的董事会成员包括剧院经理Wybrow Robertson和零售商William Whitely--旨在成为一个位于中心的水晶宫。然而，它也是为了作为一个封闭的娱乐花园，取代克里莫恩花园。

Although, as its name implies, the Royal Aquarium and Summer and Winter Gardens was ostensibly dedicated to the display of fish, it also contained many trees and plants. In 1875 the secretary to the board, Bruce Phillips, had explained that, 'It has been found that visitors to other aquariums liked to have other amusements as well as observing the fish. The directors have therefore determined to have a botanical display and there would be a Summer and Winter Garden!17 Another early promoter of the building pointed out that 'The grace and freshness of a winter garden will be a great attraction, the hall surrounded by palms and exotic trees and shrubs, the whole having the general aspect of a vast conservatory filled with splendid sculpture.!'18

尽管正如其名称所暗示的那样，皇家水族馆和夏季及冬季花园表面上致力于展示鱼类，但它也包含许多树木和植物。1875年，董事会秘书布鲁斯-菲利普斯解释说："人们发现，其他水族馆的游客除了观察鱼类外，还喜欢有其他娱乐活动。因此，董事们决定进行植物学展示，并将有一个夏季和冬季花园！17 该建筑的另一位早期推广者指出，"冬季花园的优雅和清新将是一个巨大的吸引力，大厅被棕榈树和异国情调的树木和灌木包围，整个大厅有一个巨大的温室，充满了华丽的雕塑。

The People's Palace, which combined the Beaux Arts building style with the materials of the Crystal Palace, was built to provide educational and leisure activities for the working-class population of the East End. 19 It contained, among other facilities, a winter garden, a concert hall, a reading room and a technical college. 'The People's Palace brought culture, entertainment and education to enrich the lives of the local people', explained one commentator, while The Times described the Mile End building as 'a happy experiment in practical Socialism'2 The winter garden, filled with palms, flowers and tropical fruit, was situated to the rear of the Palace's Queen's Hall. Begun in 1890, it was completed two years later and was used for concerts and refreshments (fig. 30).

人民宫结合了布鲁斯艺术的建筑风格和水晶宫的材料，是为了给东区的工人阶级提供教育和休闲活动而建造的。19 除其他设施外，它还包括一个冬季花园、一个音乐厅、一个阅览室和一所技术学院。一位评论家解释说，"人民宫带来了文化、娱乐和教育，丰富了当地人民的生活"，而《泰晤士报》则将这座位于Mile End的建筑描述为 "实用社会主义的快乐实验 "2。 冬天的花园充满了棕榈树、鲜花和热带水果，位于宫殿的女王大厅后面。它于1890年开始建造，两年后完工，用于举办音乐会和茶点（图30）。

As well as providing an education, both the Royal Aquarium and the People's Palace offered their visitors the possibility of developing good taste, and a variety of opportunities for healthy recreation. While the inclusion of plants in both venues provided an education in natural history, the very concept of the Aquarium was rooted in the idea that exposure to sea-life enhanced people's scientific knowledge of the subject. Indeed, aquaria both domestic and public - multiplied from the 1850s onwards.21 At the opening ceremony of the Royal Aquarium in 1876 Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, explained that 'The extensive aquarium, which is the main object of this institution, cannot fail, if properly directed, to stimulate the love of natural history and the acquirement of scientific knowledge.'22 The People's Palace also housed a free library, opened in 1887, and a reading room, opened a year later. The library was open to the general public, as well as to students taking classes at the Technical Trade and Science Schools that launched in 1888. Classes in tailor's cutting, carpentry, photography, needlework, French and book-keeping were among those on offer. 23

除了提供教育之外，皇家水族馆和人民宫都为游客提供了培养良好品味的可能性，以及各种健康娱乐的机会。虽然这两个场所都包含了植物，提供了自然历史的教育，但水族馆的概念是植根于这样的想法：接触海洋生物可以提高人们对这一主题的科学知识。21 在1876年皇家水族馆的开幕式上，爱丁堡公爵阿尔弗雷德王子解释说："广泛的水族馆是这个机构的主要目标，如果指导得当，就能激发人们对自然历史的热爱和对科学知识的掌握。 22 人民宫还设有一个免费图书馆，于1887年开放，一年后又开设了一个阅览室。图书馆向公众开放，同时也向1888年成立的技术贸易和科学学校的学生开放。提供的课程包括裁缝、木工、摄影、针线活、法语和簿记等。23

As the Duke of Edinburgh observed at the Aquarium's opening ceremony, 'The access to a useful reading-room, the daily performance of good music by a well-chosen orchestra, the periodical exhibition of such collections of paintings as we see around us - these are agencies which cannot but exercise a most beneficial influence in refining and cultivating the public taste:'24 Sir Arthur Sullivan was in charge of the music (for a short period), and John Everett Millais took charge of picture selection. A theatre, opened in April 1876, remained in use until 1900, when it was taken over by Lillie Langtry, who commissioned a completely new theatre that moved out of the Aquarium. High-cultural activities were also pursued at the People's Palace. As well as the concerts which took place in the winter garden, organ recitals were given in the Grand Central Hall. Art lessons were also hugely popular.

正如爱丁堡公爵在水族馆的开幕式上所说："可以进入一个有用的阅览室，每天由一个精心挑选的管弦乐队演奏好的音乐，定期展出我们周围的绘画收藏品--这些都是对完善和培养公众品味产生最有益影响的机构：24 阿瑟-沙利文爵士负责音乐（在短时间内），约翰-埃弗雷特-米莱斯负责图片选择。1876年4月开业的剧院一直使用到1900年，当时由莉莉-朗特里接管，她委托人建造了一个全新的剧院，搬出了水族馆。人民宫还开展了高级文化活动。除了在冬季花园举行的音乐会外，还在中央大厅举行了风琴演奏会。艺术课也大受欢迎。

In terms of physical activities, visitors to the Aquarium could engage in skating, cycling and boxing, while those who frequented the People's Palace could swim in the pool, exercise in the gym, roller-skate in the basement, play tennis and billiards, and dance. Traditional pastimes, including horticulture, were also encouraged at both spaces. Three shows of the National Chrysanthemum Society were held annually at the Aquarium, and similar displays also took place at the Palace. Much also went on in the Aquarium that was widely considered neither edifying nor health-giving, however, including the firing of a woman from a cannon, the exhibition of the first gorilla seen in England, and displays by performing animals and a scantily clad trapeze artist. Popular entertainment inevitably proved more lucrative than education and culture. Emphasis on such spectacles proved a short-term strategy, however, as the Aquarium's loss of reputation caused it to become desirable to nobody and it was forced to close in 1903.

在体育活动方面，水族馆的游客可以参与滑冰、骑自行车和拳击，而经常去人民宫的人可以在游泳池游泳，在健身房锻炼，在地下室滑旱冰，打网球和台球，并跳舞。传统的消遣活动，包括园艺，也在这两个地方得到鼓励。国家菊花协会每年在水族馆举办三次展览，宫廷里也有类似的展览。然而，水族馆里也有很多被广泛认为既不具教育意义也不具健康意义的活动，包括用大炮发射一个女人，展出英国第一只大猩猩，以及表演动物和衣着暴露的空中飞人的表演。大众娱乐不可避免地被证明比教育和文化更有利可图。然而，强调这种奇观被证明是一种短期策略，因为水族馆的声誉下降导致它变得无人问津，它被迫在1903年关闭。

Although the Palace did not sink quite so low, even there a tension emerged between the educational and entertainment aspects of its provision. The flower, poultry, pigeon, dog, cat and rabbit displays, which became regular events, were nevertheless relegated to sideshows, and were considered by some to be trivial pastimes compared to the more serious education provided by the classes, concerts and lectures. It was the entertainment that kept the books balanced, however. Like that of the Aquarium, the popularity of the Palace waned as the new century approached. A fire destroyed most of the building in the early 1930s, a new building was constructed, and the educational side eventually became part of Queen Mary College, University of London.

虽然皇宫没有陷得如此之深，但即使在那里，其提供的教育和娱乐之间也出现了矛盾。花卉、家禽、鸽子、狗、猫和兔子的展示已经成为定期活动，但还是被贬为杂耍，而且与课程、音乐会和讲座所提供的更严肃的教育相比，有些人认为这是微不足道的消遣。然而，正是这些娱乐活动使账目保持平衡。与水族馆一样，随着新世纪的到来，皇宫的人气也逐渐减弱。20世纪30年代初，一场大火烧毁了大部分建筑，新建了一座建筑，教育方面最终成为伦敦大学玛丽皇后学院的一部分。

**Although the Aquarium and the Palace served different purposes, they both contained plant-filled winter gardens. The inclusion of nature inside those spaces helped facilitate a seamless transition from the social activities of the nobility, undertaken in their private conservatories and public pleasure gardens, to mass urban leisure.** In the end, however, **the utopian idea of people maintaining contact with nature in an urban environment was undermined by the desire to make money and to appeal to a mass audience.** The result, arguably, was that after the turn of the century, the London-based winter gardens became less and less popular.

**虽然水族馆和皇宫有不同的用途，但它们都有充满植物的冬季花园。将自然纳入这些空间有助于促进从贵族的社会活动（在他们的私人温室和公共娱乐花园进行）向大众城市休闲的无缝过渡。**然而，最终，**人们在城市环境中与自然保持联系的乌托邦式的想法被赚钱和吸引大众观众的欲望所破坏了。**可以说，其结果是，在世纪之交后，位于伦敦的冬季花园变得越来越不受欢迎。

In contrast, the winter gardens at the British seaside lasted well into the middle of the twentieth century.25 They too aimed to provide opportunities for leisure and entertainment, and contained displays of plants and flowers. The seaside locations first became popular with wealthy visitors in the eighteenth century. As the nineteenth century progressed, the middle classes and eventually the working classes began to holiday in them as well. The unpredictability of the British weather meant that visitors needed enclosed spaces in which to parade and be entertained. The plants within those spaces encouraged holiday-makers to relax and engage in various forms of consumption.

相比之下，**英国海边的冬季花园一直持续到20世纪中期。25 它们也旨在提供休闲和娱乐的机会，并展示植物和花卉。海滨地区在十八世纪首先受到富裕游客的欢迎。随着十九世纪的发展，中产阶级和最终的工人阶级也开始在这里度假。英国天气的不可预测性意味着游客需要封闭的空间，以便在其中进行游行和娱乐。这些空间里的植物鼓励度假者放松并从事各种形式的消费。**

Advertised as the first and the largest of its kind, Southport's winter garden, located on England's northwest coast, was constructed in 1874. It combined an iron-and-glass conservatory with a second building that contained a concert hall (fig. 31). Like the Royal Aquarium, its early high-cultural ambitions proved unsuccessful financiallv and it ended up as a ballroom and roller-skating rink, while its concert hall was eventually transformed into a cinema. The managers of Blackpool's winter gardens were equally ambitious (fig. 32).26 Opened in 1878, the site combined a concert hall and a theatre with areas for promenading, including a Floral Hall and a palm-filled winter garden. The intention was to 'convert the estate into a pleasant lounge, especially desirous during inclement days', thus demonstrating its essential domesticity.27 A ballroom was added in 1896, together with an Indian Lounge.

南港的冬季花园位于英格兰的西北海岸，于1874年建成，被宣传为第一个也是最大的一个冬季花园。它将一个铁制玻璃温室与另一座包含音乐厅的建筑结合在一起（图31）。与皇家水族馆一样，它早期的高文化雄心被证明是不成功的，最终成为一个舞厅和溜冰场，而它的音乐厅最终被改造成一个电影院。黑池冬季花园的管理者同样雄心勃勃（图32）。26 1878年开放的场地将一个音乐厅和一个剧院与散步区结合起来，包括一个花厅和一个长满棕榈树的冬季花园。其目的是 "将庄园变成一个愉快的休息室，在恶劣的日子里尤其令人向往"，从而显示出其基本的家庭性。27 1896年增加了一个舞厅，以及一个印度休息室。

The south coast of England was also popular with holiday-makers. In 1875 Bournemouth opened its winter gardens. On the east coast 1903 saw the opening of Great Yarmouth's equivalent (figs 33 and 34). Originally built in Torquay, Devon, twenty-five years earlier, it had been transferred to the east coast, to what was by then an archetypical working-class seaside town. As Darren Barker has explained, it was:

英格兰南部海岸也受到度假者的欢迎。1875年，伯恩茅斯开放了它的冬季花园。在东海岸，1903年 看到了大雅茅斯的同类产品的开放（图33和34）。最初 它最初建于德文郡的托尔坎，二十五年前被转移到东海岸的 东海岸，当时是一个典型的工人阶级海滨城市。镇。正如达伦-巴克所解释的，它是。

Stuff full of exotic plants, a theatre of botany, which allowed the paying public the chance to see glimpses of faraway places, through an eclectic collection of plants from all corners of a flagging empire and beyond. For the millions of holiday makers, packing the resort in the early decades of the twentieth century, escaping for a few days from the factories and the daily grind, the Winter Gardens was an unexpected paradise. As much part of the experience as the sticks of Docwra rock, the pleasure beach rides and 'sands of finest brown sugar'28

充满异国情调的植物，一个植物学的剧院，让付费的公众有机会看到遥远地方的一瞥，通过不拘一格的植物收集，从一个正在衰退的帝国的各个角落和其他地方。**对于在二十世纪早期的几十年里，数以百万计的度假者来说，他们挤在度假村里，从工厂和日常工作中逃离几天，冬季花园是一个意外的天堂。就像多克沃拉岩石、海滩游乐设施和 "最好的红糖沙 "28一样，也是这种体验的一部分。**

An amusement arcade and a roller-skating rink were added later. Also located on the east coast, and providing an easy escape for Londoners, Margate's winter gardens were opened in 1911. They comprised a large concert hall, four entrance halls, two side wings and an amphitheatre. Popular theatre and music, together with variety acts, constituted its mainly low-brow programme of events.

后来又增加了一个游乐场和一个溜冰场。也是 位于东海岸，为伦敦人提供了一个方便的避风港。马盖特的冬季花园于1911年开放。它们包括一个大的音乐厅，四个入口大厅，以及一个小花园。音乐厅、四个入口大厅、两个侧翼和一个露天剧场。通俗戏剧和音乐，以及各种表演，构成了其主要是低俗的活动。主要是低俗的活动项目。

The concept of the palm court brought the domestic parlour and the public winter garden into a single space. Emulating aristocratic parlours and dining rooms, palm courts were formal spaces in which taking afternoon tea was often combined with listening to music and dancing. Palm courts permitted (mostly wealthy) people to feel at home and to interact with nature in spaces located within existing public buildings, from grand hotels to ocean liners to department stores. Topped by glazed skylights and filled with palms, they injected a sense of luxury and the atmosphere of a private parlour into semi-public settings. Though their inhabitants were away from home and keen to engage in social display in a public space, they also needed to feel that they were in familiar, unthreatening environments.

**棕榈园的概念将家庭客厅和公共冬季花园纳入一个单一的空间。棕榈园模仿贵族的客厅和餐厅，是正式的空间，在这里喝下午茶往往与听音乐和跳舞相结合。棕榈园让（大多数是富人）感到宾至如归，并在现有的公共建筑中与自然互动，从大饭店到远洋轮船到百货公司。顶上有玻璃天窗，种满了棕榈树，它们为半公共环境注入了豪华感和私人客厅的氛围。虽然他们的居民远离家乡，热衷于在公共空间进行社交展示，但他们也需要感觉到他们是在熟悉的、没有威胁的环境中。**

London's first hotel palm court appeared in the Langham Hotel, which opened in 1865.29 The last years of the century saw several other elegant examples introduced into London hotels, among them the Savoy, which opened in 1889 and featured a tea lounge bordered by palms and other exotic plants.3° The Carlton Hotel opened in 1899. In addition to its smoking, reading, dining, reception and retiring rooms, it also contained a vast palm court on its ground floor.31 César Ritz, who oversaw the construction of the building, had requested Mewès and Davis, the firm that designed the hotel's interiors, 'to lower the level of the Palm Court [below that of the dining room] and introduce a flight of stairs for the effective entrances and exits of London's best-dressed ladies' 32 In addition, 'a small balcony at the upper level gave a degree of privacy behind a screen of palms where the Prince of Wales could enjoy his regular visits from a vantage point over the Palm Court 33

**伦敦的第一个酒店棕榈园出现在1865年开业的朗廷酒店。**29 在本世纪的最后几年，伦敦的酒店还引进了其他一些优雅的例子，其中包括1889年开业的萨沃伊酒店，该酒店的茶厅边上有棕榈树和其他外来植物。除了吸烟室、阅览室、餐厅、接待室和退休室之外，它的底层还设有一个巨大的棕榈园。监督建筑施工的塞萨尔-里兹要求设计酒店内饰的梅韦斯和戴维斯公司 "降低棕榈庭的高度[低于餐厅的高度]，并引入一段楼梯，以便伦敦最漂亮的女士们有效地进出 "32，此外，"上层的小阳台在棕榈树幕后提供了一定程度的隐私，威尔士王子可以从棕榈庭的有利位置享受他的定期访问33

The furnishings and décor of the Carlton palm court were provided by Warings of Liverpool. Floral decorations were also introduced to reinforce the impression of luxury and public domesticity. In 1906, following the model successfully established in Paris in 1898, the London Ritz opened its doors, it too boasted an elegant palm court; in 1908 the Waldorf, a favourite among visiting Americans, opened, housing yet another impressive palm-filled room (fig. 35). As at the Carlton, the Waldorf's palm room featured a sunken area at its centre, which was accessed by a flight of steps.

卡尔顿棕榈球场的陈设和装饰是由 利物浦的华林公司提供。花卉装饰也被引入以加强 奢华和公共家庭的印象。1906年，按照1898年在巴黎成功建立的模式 1906年，按照1898年在巴黎成功建立的模式，伦敦丽兹酒店开业。它也拥有一个优雅的棕榈园；1908年，美国人最喜欢的华尔道夫酒店开业。1908年，美国人最喜欢的华尔道夫酒店开业，里面有另一个令人印象深刻的充满棕榈树的房间。(图35)。和卡尔顿酒店一样，华尔道夫酒店的棕榈房也有一个下沉式的区域，位于中心位置，可以通过一个小门进入。和卡尔顿一样，华尔道夫的棕榈房在中心有一个下沉区，可以通过一段台阶进入。

Many of continental Europe's grand hotels, including Berlin's Central Hotel and Monte Carlo's Hotel Hermitage, also featured palm courts.34 In the United States the fully fledged palm court was linked directly to the use of hotels by the newly wealthy as sites of conspicuous leisure and display. The palm garden attached to the Schlitz Hotel in Milwaukee was an early example. Built in 1895, five years after the hotel opened, it featured a barrel-vaulted ceiling and stained glass, and hosted an orchestra. San Francisco also had its share of late nineteenth-century luxury hotels, among them the Palace Hotel (fig. 36), which opened in 1875 and featured a plant- filled seven-storey atrium. The original hotel burnt down in 1906 in the fire that followed the earthquake of that year, but a new building was opened in 1909 and it too had an extravagant palm court at its centre. Most renowned of all the American examples, though, was the glamorous palm court in New York's Plaza Hotel, which opened in 1907. The Biltmore Hotel opened in the same city in 1913. Its tea room, or palm court, echoed the design of the main concourse of the Grand Central Railway Terminal, to which it was linked. Another of the many notable North American palm courts could be found in the lobby of Montreal's Ritz-Carlton Hotel, which opened in 1912.

许多欧洲大陆的大饭店，包括柏林的中央饭店和蒙特卡洛的赫米蒂奇饭店，也都设有棕榈园。34在美国，成熟的棕榈园与新富阶层将饭店作为显眼的休闲和展示场所直接相关。密尔沃基的施利茨酒店附属的棕榈园就是一个早期的例子。它建于1895年，即酒店开业后的第五年，具有桶形拱顶和彩色玻璃，并有一个管弦乐队。旧金山也有十九世纪末的豪华酒店，其中包括1875年开业的皇宫酒店（图36），它的特点是有一个充满植物的七层楼的中庭。原来的酒店在1906年的地震后的大火中被烧毁，但新的建筑在1909年启用，它的中心也有一个奢侈的棕榈园。不过，在所有美国的例子中，最著名的是1907年开业的纽约广场酒店的迷人的棕榈园。比尔特莫尔酒店于1913年在同一城市开业。它的茶室，即棕榈庭，与中央火车站的主大厅的设计相呼应，并与之相连。在蒙特利尔的丽思卡尔顿酒店的大厅里，可以找到许多著名的北美棕榈球场中的另一个，该酒店于1912年开业。

Given that ocean liners were essentially luxury hotels on water it is not surprising that, by the early twentieth century, they too frequently contained elegant palm courts and provided extravagant tea dances for their (first-class) travellers. Examples could be found on the White Star Line's SS Majestic (launched in 1889), RMS Olympic (launched in 1910) and RMS Titanic (launched in 1912); the Hamburg America Line's SS Amerika (launched in 1905), S Imperator (launched in 1912 and which later became Cunard's RMS Berengaria), SS Bismarck (launched in 1914) and SS Johann Heinrich Burchard (also launched in 1914, later sold to United American Lines and renamed Reliance); and the Holland America Line's SS Nieuw
Amsterdam (launched in 1905).

鉴于远洋客轮本质上是水上的豪华酒店，到20世纪初，它们也经常包含优雅的棕榈球场，并为其（头等舱）旅客提供奢侈的茶舞，这并不奇怪。在白星航运公司的SS Majestic（1889年下水）、RMS Olympic（1910年下水）和RMS Titanic（1912年下水）上都可以看到这样的例子。汉堡美洲航运公司的SS Amerika（1905年下水）、S Imperator（1912年下水，后来成为库纳的RMS Berengaria）、SS Bismarck（1914年下水）和SS Johann Heinrich Burchard（也是1914年下水，后来卖给美国联合航运公司，改名为Reliance）；以及荷兰美洲航运的SS Nieuw 阿姆斯特丹号（1905年下水）。

Palm courts and palm-filled sitting areas were also introduced into department stores to encourage female shoppers to relax and to spend more time and money in them. London's Harrods featured a number of such spaces. As Erika Rappaport has explained, 'stores presented themselves as safe, pleasurable, and emancipating places for urban women'35 Adding plants introduced the security of the parlour. Selfridges, which opened in London in 1909, contained a luxurious Palm Court Restaurant that was destroyed by a bomb in 1941. **In commercial settings the role of nature inside was to provide a relaxing, safe, but also stimulating and luxurious environment in which consumers could feel simultaneously at home and that they were 'out on the town', enjoying a break from chores and responsibilities. Plants succeeded in helping people cross the boundaries between reality and fantasy and between the private and the public spheres. As mass consumption expanded at the end of the nineteenth century, the role of indoor plants in encouraging that activity gradually took over from their earlier functions as religious symbols, educational tools and decorative objects.**

**棕榈球场和充满棕榈的休息区也被引入百货公司，以鼓励女性购物者放松，并在其中花费更多时间和金钱。**伦敦的哈罗德百货公司就有很多这样的空间。正如Erika Rappaport所解释的那样，"商店将自己展示为城市女性的安全、愉悦和解放的场所 "35 植物增加了客厅的安全性。1909年在伦敦开业的塞尔福里奇百货公司（Selfridges）有一个豪华的棕榈阁餐厅，但在1941年被炸弹摧毁。**在商业环境中，自然界的作用是提供一个放松、安全、但也刺激和豪华的环境，使消费者可以同时感到在家里和他们 "在城里"，享受从家务和责任中的休息。植物成功地帮助人们跨越了现实与幻想、私人领域与公共领域之间的界限。随着十九世纪末大众消费的扩大，室内植物在鼓励这种活动方面的作用逐渐取代了它们早期作为宗教象征、教育工具和装饰品的功能。**

**Palms and other exotic plants filled many other semi-public spaces in the years around the turn of the century, where they helped to create 'home from home' atmospheres.** These included private clubs, residential schools, hospitals (see fig. 107), convalescent homes (fig. 37), mental asylums and sanatoria, in all of which the plants' task was to be therapeutic. The more content the patients, it was contended, the easier they were to manage, and both time and money were saved. Many photographers' studios also featured potted plants, in order to give the impression that sitters were at home, to relax them and to provide a photogenic setting (fig. 38).

在世纪之交的几年里，棕榈树和其他外来植物充斥着许多其他半公共空间，它们有助于营造 "宾至如归 "的氛围。其中包括私人俱乐部、寄宿学校、医院（见图107）、疗养院（图37）、精神病院和疗养院，所有这些地方的植物的任务都是治疗。人们认为，病人越满足，他们就越容易管理，而且可以节省时间和金钱。许多摄影师的工作室也以盆栽为特色，以便给人以在家的印象，使他们放松，并提供一个可拍照的环境（图38）。

Although many of the urban buildings described in this chapter - the leisure centres, department stores and hotels - housed modern-looking winter gardens of iron and glass, these structures were often invisible from the street. In keeping with the surrounding environment, the main language of these architectural structures was that of nineteenth- century historicism and eclecticism. Two routes out of that conservative approach were provided by the protagonists of the British Arts and Crafts movement and by European Art Nouveau architects and designers, Who looked to the world of nature as a source of contemporary imagery. Unless conservatories were attached to their buildings, however, their efforts to represent flowers and birds, among other natural forms, in their designs for furniture and furnishings did not extend to the inclusion of living nature in their interior settings.

尽管本章中描述的许多城市建筑--休闲中心、百货公司和酒店--都有铁和玻璃的现代外观的冬季花园，但这些结构往往从街上看不到。为了与周围环境保持一致，这些建筑结构的主要语言是十九世纪的历史主义和折衷主义。英国艺术与手工艺运动的主角和欧洲新艺术派建筑师和设计师提供了两条摆脱这种保守做法的途径，他们把自然界作为当代图像的来源。**然而，除非他们的建筑上有温室，否则他们在家具和陈设的设计中表现花和鸟以及其他自然形式的努力并没有延伸到将活生生的大自然纳入他们的室内环境。**

A little later however, several international architects and designers in search of a new language for the modern age took yet another route, embracing the metaphor of the machine and promoting functionality in a manner that, in some senses, recalled the belief in rationalism that had dominated eighteenth-century Enlightenment thought. In this new context, the affective concept of domesticity became increasingly problematic, and, because of their close associations with the concept of home, indoor plants and flowers were excluded from the dominant architectural and design discourses of the new era. However, as the following chapter will explain, they did not disappear entirely.

然而，稍后，一些为现代寻找新语言的国际建筑师和设计师走了另一条路，他们接受了机器的隐喻，并以一种在某种意义上让人想起主导十八世纪启蒙思想的理性主义信念的方式来促进功能。在这种新的背景下，家庭的情感概念变得越来越有问题，而且，由于它们与家的概念密切相关，室内植物和花卉被排除在新时代的主流建筑和设计话语之外。然而，正如下一章将解释的那样，它们并没有完全消失。

Although the ideas and forms of Victorian middle-class domesticitv continued to spread through society in the years after 1914, both in and beyond the home, its rich symbolism was gradually diluted by the growth of secularism, by the increasing emphasis on (masculine) rationality, science and technology, and by progressive architects' negative association of the concept of home with bourgeois culture and the marketplace. By the inter-war ears of the twentieth century domesticity had been relegated, for the most part, to the conservative spaces of the suburbs. **As the urban masses came to dominate the public sphere in the aftermath of the First World War, the world of Victorian and Edwardian winter gardens, and the semi- public exoticism and luxury of the palm court, also disappeared from view.**

尽管维多利亚时代中产阶级的家庭观念和形式在1914年之后的几年里继续在社会中传播，无论是在家里还是在外面，其丰富的象征意义被世俗主义的发展、对（男性）理性、科学和技术的日益强调以及进步的建筑师将家庭的概念与资产阶级文化和市场的负面联系逐渐淡化。到了二十世纪的战时，家庭生活在很大程度上被归入了郊区的保守空间。<u>**随着城市大众在第一次世界大战后开始主导公共领域，维多利亚和爱德华时代的冬季花园世界，以及棕榈球场的半公共异国情调和奢华，也从视野中消失了。**</u>

**At that time, a generation of forward-looking architects and designers working under the banner of what later came to be known as 'modernism' set out consciously to eliminate the concept of private domesticity from both their residential and their public buildings.** Driven by a utopian desire to start from scratch, to modernise and democratise their buildings, and to eliminate clutter - which, in their minds, was synonymous with the stuffy world of their childhoods, upward aspiration, conspicuous display, excessive materialism and femininity - they sought to create rationally conceived, minimally furnished inside spaces that were extensions of their architectural frames and, ideally, indistinguishable from them. At its most extreme this approach led to the elimination of the interior in favour of a seamlessness between inside and outside spaces that denied the possibility of enclosure. The new aesthetic made a strong commitment to light and air, and drew heavily on the metaphor of the machine and the geometry and rationality these designers and architects believed to flow from it. **The concept of 'home' came under scrutiny and was replaced by the term 'dwelling', a significant shift that prioritised functionality over the world of the emotions and the senses.**

当时，在后来被称为 "现代主义 "的旗帜下工作的一代前瞻性建筑师和设计师，有意识地从他们的住宅和公共建筑中消除私人家庭的概念。**<u>在一种乌托邦式的愿望的驱使下，他们从头开始，使他们的建筑现代化和民主化，并消除杂乱无章的现象--在他们的心目中，杂乱无章的现象是他们童年的闷热世界、向上的愿望、显眼的展示、过度的物质主义和女性化的同义词--他们试图创造合理的构思，最小化的内部空间，作为建筑框架的延伸，最好与它们没有什么区别。</u>**在最极端的情况下，这种方法导致了内部空间的消除，以支持内部和外部空间之间的无缝连接，否认了封闭的可能性。新的美学对光线和空气做出了强有力的承诺，并大量借鉴了机器的隐喻以及这些设计师和建筑师认为从机器中产生的几何学和理性。**家 "的概念受到了审查，并被 "住宅 "一词所取代，这是一个重大的转变，将功能置于情感和感官世界之上。**

In spite of the general trend to eliminate all signs of home, the notion of a new domestic interior fit for the machine age was discussed by some writers. In 1929, for example, Dorothy Todd and Raymond Mortimer acknowledged that there was still a place for individualism in the age of mass production, but that, in interiors, its expression needed to eliminate unnecessary decoration and recognise the importance of light and openness.? Plants and flowers also continued to play a role in many modernist interiors. Although they existed in tension with the dominant rhetoric of progress and the metaphor of the machine, they provided a level of decoration that several modernist architects deemed appropriate. Arguably, nature inside contributed to a new model of modern domesticity, one in which plants and flowers played an increasingly important aesthetic role, reinforcing the modernists' preoccupation with the articulation of space, and softening the hard materials-concrete, steel and glass - that otherwise prevailed.

尽管普遍的趋势是消除所有家庭的标志，但一些作家还是讨论了适合机器时代的新的家庭内部装饰的概念。例如，1929年，多萝西-托德和雷蒙德-莫蒂默承认，在大规模生产的时代，个人主义仍有一席之地，但在室内，其表达需要消除不必要的装饰，并认识到光线和开放的重要性。**植物和花卉也继续在许多现代主义的室内发挥着作用。尽管它们与主流的进步修辞和机器的隐喻存在着矛盾，但它们提供了一种装饰，一些现代主义建筑师认为这是合适的。可以说，室内的自然环境促成了一种新的现代家庭模式，其中植物和花卉发挥了越来越重要的审美作用，加强了现代主义者对空间衔接的关注，并软化了硬材料--混凝土、钢铁和玻璃--否则就会占优势。**

In 2007 Paul Overy became one of the first architectural historians to document the presence of nature in modernist interiors. He observed, for example, that 'In one of the early photographs of the entrance hall of the Villa Savoye, a vase of flowers can be seen placed on the plain hall table attached to one of the pilotis.!3 This comment was unusual. Although flowers and plants were one of the few forms of ornament admitted into the modernist interior, they were studiously ignored by contemporary critics and by later historians of the movement, who have tended to focus on its more mechanistic elements.

2007年，保罗-奥维（Paul Overy）成为第一批记录自然界在现代主义室内的存在的建筑历史学家之一。例如，他指出，"在萨沃伊别墅入口大厅的一张早期照片中，可以看到一个花瓶放在连接到其中一个试点的普通大厅桌子上"。**尽管花卉和植物是现代主义室内装饰中为数不多的几种形式之一，但它们却被当代批评家和后来的运动史学家刻意忽略了，他们倾向于关注其更多的机械主义元素。**

Although the rhetoric that accompanied modernism ignored indoor plants and flowers, nature in its most general and abstract sense was addressed by several architects working in the inter-war years who embraced an organic version of modernism. Earlier in the century the American architect Louis Sullivan had described the creation of architectural form as emulating the process of a growing plant, which begins with a root, develops into a stem, and finally produces leaves and flowers. His pupil Frank Lloyd Wright followed in his path.+ Natural laws with their own internal geometries provided, the advocates of the organic model believed, inspiration for the production and understanding of architecture. Later, the German architect and organic modernist Hugo Häring explained, 'If we prefer to search for shapes rather than to propose them, to discover forms rather than to construct them, we are in harmony with nature.'S Yet although, on one level, the approach of the organic modernists contrasted with the form of modernism that took the machine as a starting point, and for which strict geometry was a given, their work was still rooted in a form of abstraction.

虽然伴随着现代主义的言论忽略了室内的植物和花卉，但在战时工作的几位建筑师在最普遍和最抽象的意义上讨论了自然，他们接受了有机版的现代主义。**在本世纪早些时候，美国建筑师路易斯-沙利文将建筑形式的创造描述为模仿植物生长的过程，即从根开始，发展成茎，最后长出叶子和花朵。他的学生弗兰克-劳埃德-赖特沿着他的道路前进。+ 有机模式的倡导者认为，自然法则及其自身的内部几何形状为建筑的生产和理解提供了灵感。后来，德国建筑师和有机现代主义者Hugo Häring解释说："如果我们宁愿寻找形状而不是提出它们，发现形式而不是构建它们，我们就能与自然和谐相处。"然而，尽管在一个层面上，有机现代主义者的方法与现代主义的形式形成对比，后者以机器为起点，严格的几何学是既定的，他们的作品仍然扎根于一种抽象形式。**

Rather than seeing it as wild, dangerous and unruly, the modernists saw nature - especially as manifested in sunlight and fresh air - as benign, generous and helpful to human beings." As a result, they often constructed their villas and apartment blocks in direct relationship with the more or less tamed gardens, grounds and landscapes that surrounded them and onto which they looked, taking great care to maximise the amount of sunlight entering them. The strikingly progressive, white, flat-roofed, ribbon-windowed buildings on the Weissenhof Estate, which was created as part of the Deutscher Werkbund's Stuttgart exhibition of 1927, were set on a hill that was covered with grass, trees and bushes. The architects involved considered that natural setting to be an integral part of their designs. Writing later about the Stuttgart project, Overy felt that '[Hans] Scharoun, [Adolf] Rading and [Richard] Docker integrated their houses with the landscape and terrain more effectively and unobtrusively than most of the other architects at Weissenhof!

**现代主义者没有把它看成是野生的、危险的和不守规矩的，而是把自然--特别是表现在阳光和新鲜空气中的自然--看成是良性的、慷慨的和有助于人类的。**因此，他们在建造他们的别墅和公寓楼时，往往与他们周围或多或少被驯服的花园、场地和景观有直接的关系，他们非常注意使进入它们的阳光量最大化。魏森霍夫庄园引人注目的先进的白色平顶带状窗建筑，是作为德国工作协会1927年斯图加特展览的一部分而建造的，坐落在一个长满草、树和灌木的山上。参与的建筑师们认为这种自然环境是他们设计的一个组成部分。Overy后来写到斯图加特项目时，认为"[汉斯]沙隆、[阿道夫]拉丁和[理查德]多克将他们的房子与景观和地形结合起来，比魏森霍夫的大多数其他建筑师更有效、更不显眼！"。

The house that Hans Scharoun created for Fritz Schminke, the owner of a noodle factory, in Löbau, Germany, in 1930-33 was an exercise in organic modernism (fig. 39). Surrounded by extensive grasslands, formed into a garden by Herta Hammerbacher, the house was pushed into a sloping site at an angle that gave its inhabitants a view across the garden and the fields beyond. A strong dynamic relationship was thereby created between the house and the garden.& The house also featured a winter garden on its ground floor. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Villa Tugendhat of 1929-30, built in Brno in the modern Czech Republic (the subiect of the following chapter), also took full advantage of the garden that surrounded it, while Le Corbusier's Villa Savoye (1928), built in Poissy, France, hovered on pilotis over a relatively untamed piece of sloping land covered with grass and trees. A rectangular cut-out in the concrete wall of the villa's roof terrace acted as a frame, taking full advantage of the view of nature beyond. Le Corbusier's concept of the promenade architecturale also linked the landscape seamlessly to the villa, creating a dynamic dialogue between nature and culture. Le Corbusier had shown an early interest in the natural world: in 1910, for instance, he had drawn the orangery at Sanssouci, and a couple of years later he drew the example at Versailles. It was not until 1930, however, that he became interested in natural objects - including shells, bones, wood and flint - which he associated with a form of primitivism and which inspired a great deal of his later work.?

汉斯-沙隆于1930-1933年在德国Löbau为面条厂老板Fritz Schminke建造的房子是**有机现代主义**的一个实践（图39）。房子被Herta Hammerbacher设计的花园所包围，被推到一个倾斜的地方，使其居民可以看到花园和外面的田野。因此，房子和花园之间形成了一种强烈的动态关系。Ludwig Mies van der Rohe于1929-30年在现代捷克共和国的布尔诺建造的Tugendhat别墅（下一章的主题）也充分利用了它周围的花园，而Le Corbusier在法国Poissy建造的Savoye别墅（1928年）则盘旋在一块相对不驯服的、长满草和树的坡地上。别墅屋顶平台的混凝土墙体上的一个长方形切口作为框架，充分利用了外面的自然景观。勒-柯布西耶的建筑长廊概念也将景观与别墅无缝连接起来，在自然和文化之间创造了一个动态的对话。勒-柯布西耶很早就对自然界产生了兴趣：例如，在1910年，他画了桑苏西的桔园，几年后他又画了凡尔赛的例子。然而，直到1930年，他才开始对自然物体感兴趣--包括贝壳、骨头、木材和燧石--他将其与一种**原始主义**的形式联系起来，并激发了他后来大量的作品。

Eileen Gray's Villa E-1027 of 1926-9, built with Jean Badovici in Roquebrune, southern France, took full advantage of its situation close to the Mediterranean Sea, which provided the main view from the front of the house (fig. 40). When, in 1951, Le Corbusier constructed his little Cabanon next to Gray's house, he too was undoubtedly attracted by the site and its close links to nature. Across the Atlantic in Pennsylvania, Fallingwater, a house designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1935 for Edgar J. Kaufman, took the idea of placing a building in a natural setting even further (see fig. 91). As Timothy Benton has observed, 'the design for Fallingwater brings out Wright's obsession with making a dwelling partake of the landscape in as intimate a way as possible. The house not only straddles a small waterfall but is open to the stream ... and bathed in the sounds of the moving water!'° No effort was made to hide the house in the nature that enveloped it; the goal was rather to create a visual dialogue between them.

艾琳-格雷的E-1027号别墅是1926-19年与让-巴多维奇在法国南部的罗克布伦建造的，它充分利用了靠近地中海的位置，从房子的前面看去，地中海是主要的景观（图40）。1951年，勒-柯布西耶在格雷的房子旁边建造了他的小卡巴农，毫无疑问，他也被这个地方和它与自然的密切联系所吸引。在大西洋彼岸的宾夕法尼亚州，弗兰克-劳埃德-赖特于1935年为埃德加-J-考夫曼设计的房子Fallingwater，将建筑置于自然环境中的想法更进一步（见图91）。正如蒂莫西-本顿所观察到的，"Fallingwater的设计带出了赖特对以尽可能亲密的方式使住宅融入景观的迷恋。房子不仅横跨一个小瀑布，而且向溪流开放......并沐浴在流动的水声中！"° 没有努力将房子隐藏在笼罩它的大自然中；目标是在它们之间创造一种视觉对话。

The occupants of many modernist villas and apartments could engage directly with the natural world outside their buildings through the introduction of horizontal picture windows that framed picturesque slices of the exterior view. The 'pictures' thus created acted as substitutes for the works of art that might have otherwise adorned the walls. Writing of the United States in the vears after the Second World War, the architectural historian Sandy Isenstadt has maintained that buildings were placed so firmly in their natural settings that those rectangular pieces of glass had come to be understood as a 'harbinger of the good life'. Most significantly in the context of taming nature and transforming it into culture, Isenstadt states that 'framing" was the learned activity that transformed nature into landscape'11

许多现代主义的别墅和公寓的居住者可以通过引入水平画窗来直接接触建筑外的自然世界，这些画窗框住了风景如画的外景片断。这样创造出来的 "图片 "可以替代原本装饰在墙上的艺术品。建筑历史学家桑迪-伊森斯塔特（Sandy Isenstadt）在写到二战后的美国时认为，建筑物被牢牢地置于其自然环境中，那些长方形的玻璃片已被理解为 "美好生活的预兆"。**在驯服自然并将其转化为文化的背景下，伊森斯塔特指出，"框架 "是将自然转化为景观的学习活动，这一点最为重要。**

**Many modernist architects used a cluster of architectural features including balconies, verandas, terraces, roof gardens and external staircases, to extend their buildings out into nature, to let in light and sunshine, to facilitate seamlessness between inside and outside, and to avoid the sense of enclosure that had been the norm in most Victorian buildings.** **A house in Pasadena designed in 1908 by the local architectural partnership Greene & Greene exemplifies that seamlessness**. Built as a winter home for David and Mary Gamble, three of the first-floor bedrooms of the Gamble House had exterior sleeping porches leading directly from them. Covered over, they were nonetheless open to the elements at the sides. Window boxes filled with trailing ivy were attached to the exterior walls as a means of linking the porches to the outside world of nature. Two decades later, Le Corbusier included the use of terraces and roof gardens in his 'five points of architecture", which he published at the time of the Deutscher Werkbund exhibition. 12 His Villa Stein of 1926 (on the outskirts of Paris) incorporated a complex system of them. Balconies were also widely used by many of the architects who created buildings for the Weissenhof Estate, Scharoun and Rading among them, as were stepped terraces, which made many of the buildings resemble ocean liners 13 The emphasis was on outward-facing living, and on engaging with nature outside. One model for the approach was provided by contemporary tuberculosis sanatoria, where patients were exposed to the outdoor elements once a day. 14

**<u>许多现代主义建筑师使用了一系列的建筑特征，包括阳台、游廊、露台、屋顶花园和外部楼梯，将他们的建筑延伸到大自然中，让光线和阳光照射进来，促进内部和外部的无缝衔接，并避免大多数维多利亚时代建筑中的封闭感。</u>****1908年帕萨迪纳的一栋房子由当地的建筑伙伴Greene & Greene设计，是这种无缝性的典范**。作为David和Mary Gamble的冬季居所，Gamble之家一楼的三间卧室都有直接通往外部的睡廊。虽然有遮盖物，但它们的两侧还是向外界开放的。外墙上挂满了长春藤的窗框，作为将门廊与外面的自然世界联系起来的一种手段。20年后，勒-柯布西耶将露台和屋顶花园的使用纳入他的 "建筑的五个要点"，他在德国工业联合会展览时发表了这一观点。12 他在1926年建造的斯坦因别墅（位于巴黎郊区）就包含了一个复杂的系统。阳台也被许多为魏森霍夫庄园设计建筑的建筑师广泛使用，其中包括沙鲁恩和拉丁，还有阶梯式露台，这使得许多建筑都像海轮13强调的是面向外部的生活，以及与外部自然的接触。当代结核病疗养院提供了这种方法的一个模式，在那里，病人每天都要接触一次户外环境。14

According to Overy, Scharoun's Villa Schminke was 'more balcony than house!1s It also featured an external staircase and numerous terraces that served to link the house to the garden. The design also took the association with ocean liners to a new level, including the addition of what looked like ships' railings. The houses built for the Bauhaus masters in Dessau were also exercises in indoor/outdoor ambiguity, so defined were they by their balconies, terraces and roof terraces (fig. 41). The same strategies were soon deployed all over Europe. In France, Robert Mallet-Stevens's Villa Noailles (1923-7) featured a sleeping terrace with electrically operated mosquito curtains, while in Austria, Richard Neutra's 1932 house for the Vienna Werkbundsiedlung boasted a roof terrace. 16 Many apartment blocks of the period also featured balconies, which acted as substitutes for gardens and in which potted plants and window boxes were common elements. Those introduced into the Siemensstadt residential estate in Berlin, masterminded by Scharoun and built between 1929 and 1934, were a case in point.

据Overy说，Scharoun的Schminke别墅 "与其说是房子，不如说是阳台！1s它还具有一个外部楼梯和许多露台，用来连接房子和花园。该设计还将与海轮的联系提升到了一个新的高度，包括增加看起来像船的栏杆。为德绍的包豪斯大师们建造的房屋也是室内/室外模糊性的练习，它们被阳台、露台和屋顶平台所界定（图41）。同样的策略很快被部署到欧洲各地。在法国，Robert Mallet-Stevens的Noailles别墅（1923-7）有一个带电动蚊帐的睡眠露台，而在奥地利，Richard Neutra在1932年为维也纳Werkbundsiedlung设计的房子有一个屋顶露台。16 这一时期的许多公寓楼也都有阳台，它可以代替花园，其中的盆栽和窗框是常见的元素。1929年至1934年期间，由沙隆策划建造的柏林西门子城住宅区的阳台就是一个典型的例子。

While siting a building in a natural setting, enabling inhabitants to view that setting from inside, and utilising various architectural features to blur the boundaries between the insides and outsides of buildings represented some of the ways in which the modernist interior was made to interact with the natural world, another strategy resulted in an even more intimate relationship between them. Several modernist structures were designed and built around trees that were already growing on the site. This particular architectural intervention took respect for the natural world one step further, demonstrating a reverence for nature in its growing state. The idea went back to the Crystal Palace, which, as we have seen, accommodated several large elms that were already established on its Hyde Park site. The act of enclosing trees represented continuity and disruption simultaneously. The trees could continue to grow, albeit within an artificial enclosure, and. although they were separated from other trees located outside the structure, they remained untouched and protected.

虽然将建筑置于自然环境中，**<u>使居民能够从内部观看环境，并利用各种建筑特征来模糊建筑内部和外部的界限，代表了现代主义内部与自然世界互动的一些方式，</u>**但另一种策略导致了它们之间更亲密的关系。**一些现代主义建筑是围绕着已经生长在工地上的树木设计和建造的。这种特殊的建筑干预将对自然界的尊重向前推进了一步，显示了对处于生长状态的自然的敬畏。这个想法可以追溯到水晶宫，正如我们所看到的，它容纳了几棵已经在海德公园场地上建立起来的大榆树。**围住树木的行为同时代表了连续性和破坏性。这些树可以继续生长，尽管是在一个人工围栏内，而且，尽管它们与位于结构外的其他树木分开，但它们仍然没有被触动和保护。

As the Crystal Palace had been a temporary enclosure, there was a logic to leaving the trees on site. The same could be said about the tree that was left on site when Le Corbusier designed his little Esprit Nouveau pavilion for the 1925 International Exhibition in Paris. By cutting a circle in the roof and allowing the tree to grow through it, Le Corbusier transformed the tree into an architectural feature. Since the pavilion was only temporary, that approach made some practical sense. However, between 1889 and 1895, Frank Lloyd Wright implemented a similar strategy in his own home in Oak Park, outside Chicago, in which he constructed a passage between the home and the studio so as to avoid disturbing a willow tree that was growing there. His gesture represented something somewhat different: a respect for nature in its wild state and a desire to blend it with architecture as sensitively as possible. 17 A similar impulse is apparent in Le Corbusier's later design for the Curutchet House in Argentina (1948-53), where the architect once again left a tree on site - an act that was, simultaneously, both non-interventionist and one of containment. In the Mill Owners' Association Building in Ahmedabad, India, designed in 1951, Le Corbusier went a step further still, leaving the façade largely open so that plants could grow on it, thereby letting nature itself act as the boundary between the interior and the exterior of the building.

由于水晶宫是一个临时性的建筑，所以把树留在现场是有一定道理的。当勒-柯布西耶为1925年的巴黎国际博览会设计他的小新艺术馆时，也可以说是把树留在了现场。通过在屋顶上切开一个圆圈，让树从里面长出来，勒-柯布西耶把树变成了一个建筑特征。由于该馆只是临时性的，这种做法有一定的实际意义。然而，在1889年和1895年之间，弗兰克-劳埃德-赖特在他自己位于芝加哥郊外橡树园的家中实施了一个类似的策略，他在住宅和工作室之间建造了一条通道，以避免干扰生长在那里的一棵柳树。他的姿态代表了某种不同的东西：对野生状态下的自然的尊重，以及尽可能敏感地将其与建筑融合的愿望。17 类似的冲动在勒-柯布西耶后来设计的阿根廷库鲁切特住宅（1948-53）中也很明显，建筑师再次在现场留下了一棵树--这种行为同时也是一种不干涉主义和遏制主义。**在1951年设计的印度艾哈迈达巴德的磨坊主协会大楼中，勒-柯布西耶更进一步，将立面基本开放，使植物可以在上面生长，从而让自然本身成为建筑内部和外部的界限。**

**Indoor winter gardens offered another means of bringing nature, in the form of plants and flowers, inside modernist houses.** Although rooted in the attached Victorian conservatory, the strategy embraced by modernists brought nature even further into the interior. It recalled the approach adopted earlier in the century by Isabella Stewart Gardner, who had wanted her garden to be located at the very heart of her building. An organically shaped winter garden in the aforementioned Villa Schminke, filled with exotic plants, flowers and a water basin, was positioned next to the main living area, separated from it by a low curved rail.

**室内冬季花园提供了另一种手段，以植物和花卉的形式将自然带入现代主义房屋。**虽然植根于维多利亚时期的附属温室，但现代主义者所接受的策略将自然界进一步带入室内。这让人想起本世纪初伊莎贝拉-斯图尔特-加德纳（Isabella Stewart Gardner）采取的方法，她希望她的花园位于她的建筑的中心。前面提到的施明克别墅中的一个有机形状的冬季花园，充满了异国情调的植物、鲜花和水盆，被安置在主生活区旁边，用一个低矮的弧形轨道与之隔开。

Walter Gropius introduced winter gardens into two of the private houses he created in Jena: the Auerbach House of 1924 and the Zuckerkandl House of 1927-9.18 On its ground floor the former featured a fully glazed, steel-constructed conservatory with three windows facing east, a south-facing double door, and three removable windows that interfaced with the dining room and could be concealed behind wooden blinds. Like Scharoun's Villa Schminke, the three-storey Zuckerkandl House was built into a steep slope. A glazed conservatory, topped by a terrace, protrudes from the façade of the middle floor. In an exterior photograph taken in 2009, exotic potted plants, including cacti and agaves, can be observed on its tiered shelves (fig. 42).

沃尔特-格罗皮乌斯在耶拿建造的两座私人住宅中引入了冬季花园：1924年的奥尔巴赫住宅和1927-19年的祖克坎德尔住宅。18前者的底层有一个全玻璃的钢结构温室，有三个朝东的窗户，一个朝南的双开门，还有三个可移动的窗户，与餐厅相通，可以隐藏在木质百叶窗后面。与沙鲁恩的Schminke别墅一样，三层楼的Zuckerkandl别墅也建在一个陡峭的斜坡上。一个玻璃温室，上面有一个露台，从中间一层的外墙上伸出来。在2009年拍摄的一张外部照片中，可以看到层层叠叠的架子上摆放着奇异的盆栽，包括仙人掌和琼花（图42）。

In 1927 the Viennese architect Josef Frank designed a conservatory in the house he built in Vienna for Anna Lang and her first husband, Robert. 19 He created yet another example for a residence at Wenzgasse 12, Vienna (1929-31), which he designed with Oskar Wlach. Although a modernist, Frank espoused a soft, textile-led, domestic aesthetic in his interiors, in which plants and flowers played an important part. The decorating company that he ran with Wlach from 1925 onwards - Haus & Garten - was responsible for many eclectic interiors that embraced nature in a number of ways. A late-1920s drawing for a living area that Frank created for Johann Bochynek, for example, featured a mixture of eighteenth-century and modern furniture styles as well as a small winter garden leading off the room through a door in a glazed wall. The architects Alfred and Emil Roth also positioned an indoor garden, containing a mother-in-law's tongue, in the ground-floor entrance of the apartments they built with Marcel Breuer for Sigfried Giedion in Doldertal, a suburb of Zurich (1935-6). They offset the garden with a large, abstract piece of organic sculpture created by the English sculptor Barbara Hepworth (fig. 43).

1927年，维也纳建筑师约瑟夫-弗兰克在他为安娜-朗和她的第一任丈夫罗伯特在维也纳建造的房子里设计了一个音乐厅。19他又为维也纳文茨街12号的住宅设计了另一个例子（1929-31），他与奥斯卡-瓦拉赫一起设计的。虽然是一个现代主义者，但弗兰克在他的室内装修中崇尚一种柔和的、以纺织品为主导的家庭美学，其中植物和花卉发挥了重要作用。从1925年起，他与瓦拉赫经营的装饰公司--Haus & Garten--负责许多**折衷主义**的室内装饰，以多种方式拥抱自然。例如，弗兰克在20世纪20年代末为约翰-博希内克（Johann Bochynek）设计的一张生活区的图纸，其特点是混合了十八世纪和现代的家具风格，以及通过玻璃墙上的一扇门通往房间外的小型冬季花园。建筑师阿尔弗雷德和埃米尔-罗斯（Alfred and Emil Roth）也在他们与马塞尔-布劳尔（Marcel Breuer）在苏黎世郊区的多尔德塔尔（Doldertal）为西格弗里德-吉迪恩（Sigfried Giedion）建造的公寓的底层入口处布置了一个室内花园，里面有一个岳母的舌头（1935-6）。他们用英国雕塑家芭芭拉-赫普沃斯（Barbara Hepworth）创作的大型抽象有机雕塑抵消了这个花园（图43）。

Winter gardens also found their way into many non-residential modernist interiors, especially ones that acted as homes from home. Recalling the spectacular palm courts of the early twentieth century, an extensive winter garden was introduced into the French ocean liner SS Normandie, which was launched in 1932 (fig. 44). Filled with exotic plants, including palms, and tiered birdcages, it provided a glamorous, restful place in which travellers could sit in wicker chairs, take refreshment, and imagine they were in the tropics.

冬季花园也出现在许多非住宅的现代主义室内，特别是那些作为家庭住宅的室内。回顾二十世纪初壮观的棕榈球场，1932年下水的法国诺曼底号（SS Normandie）中引入了一个广泛的冬季花园（图44）。它充满了异国情调的植物，包括棕榈树和层层叠叠的鸟笼，提供了一个迷人的休息场所，旅客们可以坐在柳条椅上，吃点东西，想象他们是在热带地区。

The European habit of using double panes of glass in windows in order to retain heat provided another perfect opportunity to bring plants inside, as the spaces between the window panes acted as miniature greenhouses. Two Italian modernist buildings included plants in this way. The first, the Electric House of 1930, was designed by Group 7 (Luigi Figini and Gino Pollini, in particular) for the Fourth International Triennial Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Mona (fig. 45). Corbusian in design, the gap between the two, 33-foot-long, L-shaped panes of glass at the front of the building - a shallow greenhouse, in effect - contained a row of cacti set into a long, thin bed of sand and stones. Their role was, once again, to create a sense of permeability between inside and outside. The reference to nature contrasted starkly with the central function of the building, which was to promote technologically advanced electrical appliances and showcase a range of new materials, including chromed metal, celluloid and linoleum.

**欧洲人在窗户上使用双层玻璃以保持热量的习惯为将植物引入室内提供了另一个完美的机会，因为窗玻璃之间的空间起到了微型温室的作用。**两座意大利现代主义建筑以这种方式包括了植物。第一个是1930年的 "电屋"，由第七组（特别是路易吉-菲吉尼和吉诺-波利尼）为在莫纳举行的第四届国际现代装饰和工业艺术三年展设计（图45）。Corbusian的设计，建筑正面两块33英尺长的L型玻璃之间的空隙--实际上是一个浅浅的温室--有一排仙人掌，镶嵌在一个长长的、薄薄的沙石床上。它们的作用是再次创造一种内部和外部之间的可渗透感。对自然的引用与该建筑的中心功能形成鲜明对比，后者是为了推广技术先进的电器，并展示一系列新材料，包括镀铬金属、赛璐珞和油布。

The Villa Necchi Campiglio in Milan was designed between 1932 and 1935 by Piero Portaluppi for the sisters Gigina and Nedda Necchi and Angelo Campiglio, Gigina's husband (fig. 46). Although the style was more novecento than modernist, and the interior furnishings were overtly  luxurious - antiques, and artworks both old and new - the building embraced plants inside in a similar way to the Electric House. They were placed in the miniature greenhouse created by the space between the panes of the large double-glazed windows in the veranda room, which was comfortably furnished like a living room with upholstered chairs and a coffee table. The captured plants foregrounded the view of the garden that lay beyond them. Looking out onto the garden involved taking in two layers of greenery, the first comprising the small cultivated plants in the space between the window panes, and the second consisting of the larger-scale, wilder nature beyond.20

米兰的Necchi Campiglio别墅是由Piero Portaluppi在1932年至1935年间为Gigina和Nedda Necchi姐妹以及Gigina的丈夫Angelo Campiglio设计的（图46）。尽管该建筑的风格与其说是现代主义的，不如说是novecento的，而且内部陈设也很奢华--古董和新旧艺术品--但该建筑以类似于 "电屋 "的方式将植物纳入其中。它们被放置在阳台房间的大型双层玻璃窗的窗格之间所形成的微型温室中，阳台房间被布置得像客厅一样舒适，有软垫椅子和咖啡桌。捕捉到的植物突出了它们之外的花园的景色。向外看花园的时候，就会看到两层绿色，第一层是窗玻璃之间的小型栽培植物，第二层则是窗外更大规模的野生自然。

In order to avoid loose clutter in their interiors, certain modernist architects liked to build furniture into the structure of their buildings. One of the ways in which they included plants in their indoor settings was by creating built-in planters and shelves to demonstrate that, rather than being mere afterthoughts, the plants were integral components of their interior schemes. Frank Lloyd Wright used built-in planters on the exterior of many of his buildings. The Robie House in Chicago (1910), for example, had 'planters hidden in nearly every horizontal ledge'21 A decade later his Hollyhock House (1919-21), built in Los Angeles in the Mayan Revival style for the oil heiress Louise Aline Barnsdall, who had requested a 'half house, half garden;, featured numerous rectangular concrete planters situated both inside and outside the building (see fig. 64).22

为了避免室内的松散杂乱，某些现代主义建筑师喜欢在他们的建筑结构中建造家具。**他们将植物纳入室内环境的方法之一是创建内置式花盆和架子，以表明植物不是单纯的事后诸葛亮，而是其室内方案的组成部分。**弗兰克-劳埃德-赖特在他的许多建筑的外部使用了内置花盆。例如，芝加哥的罗比屋（1910年）"几乎每个水平窗台都藏有花盆 "21。十年后，他在洛杉矶为石油女继承人路易丝-艾琳-巴恩斯达尔建造了玛雅复兴风格的霍利霍克屋（1919-21年），她要求有一个 "半屋半园"，建筑内外都设有许多矩形混凝土花盆（见图64）22。

Although the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto embraced Corbusian principles in many of his buildings, working alongside his wife, Aino, he also developed an aesthetic of domesticity that embraced soft elements, among them natural materials, textiles and indoor plants. The Rihitie House in the Munkkiniemi area, just outside Helsinki, which the couple designed and inhabited together, has been described by Juhani Pallasmaa as 'a convincing compromise between the radical tendencies of invention and novelty, and the romantic concern for tradition and familiarity' (fig. 47).23 Completed in 1936, it contained built-in wooden planters positioned at the bases of the windows in the living and dining rooms, which were filled with potted plants. Ivy was trained to cover the fireplace wall. The house also featured a roof terrace, a balcony and an exterior patio that linked the house to the garden. Aino Aalto, who made many of the textiles for the house, was fond of plants, especially cacti and agaves, and it is very likely that she was responsible for their inclusion.24 In 1937 she designed and had made two organically shaped ceramic plant pots for the house, which were used on the terrace.

尽管芬兰建筑师阿尔瓦-阿尔托在他的许多建筑中采用了柯布西主义原则，但他与他的妻子艾诺一起工作时，也发展了一种接受软性元素的家庭美学，其中包括自然材料、纺织品和室内植物。尤哈尼-帕拉斯马（Juhani Pallasmaa）将位于赫尔辛基郊外蒙基涅米（Munkkiniemi）地区的Rihitie住宅描述为 "在发明和新颖的激进倾向与对传统和熟悉的浪漫关注之间达成了令人信服的妥协"（图47）23。常春藤被训练来覆盖壁炉墙。这座房子还有一个屋顶露台、一个阳台和一个连接房子和花园的外部庭院。艾诺-阿尔托（Aino Aalto）为房子制作了许多纺织品，她喜欢植物，尤其是仙人掌和龙舌兰，很可能是她促成了这些植物的加入。24 1937年，她为房子设计并制作了两个有机形状的陶瓷植物盆，在露台上使用。

The rooms that the German architect and designer Marcel Breuer created in 1927 for the Berlin apartment of the theatre producer Erwin Piscator, are often presented as classic examples of modernist interior design (fig. 48). Sparsely decorated and furnished with metal and glass items, they were strikingly minimal. And yet, in the living area, positioned above a radiator on the wall that separated that space from the dining room, a small wooden shelf hosted a row of tiny potted cacti, a plant that Christopher Wilk has claimed is often considered 'the plant of the modernist interior's The choice of that exotic plant, made possible by the advent of central heating, was undoubtedly driven by the fact that its small, simple, sculptural forms suited the look and feel of modernist interiors. **<u>The cactus also had a wide set of cultural references. Given its links to Mexico and the desert it suggested a place unlike northern Europe, one that was sun-drenched and associated with primitive art forms. Often used evocatively by novelists of the era, D. H. Lawrence among them, and painted by such artists as Charles Sheeler, in the age of mechanisation and mass production the cactus represented the exotic 'other', replacing the imperial palm of the previous century (fig. 49).26</u>**

德国建筑师和设计师马塞尔-布留尔（Marcel Breuer）于1927年为戏剧制作人埃尔温-皮斯卡托（Erwin Piscator）在柏林的公寓设计的房间，**经常被作为现代主义室内设计的经典范例（图48**）。它们的装饰和家具都是由金属和玻璃物品组成的，令人印象深刻的简约。然而，在起居室里，在将该空间与餐厅隔开的墙上的散热器上方，一个小木架上摆放着一排小盆仙人掌，**克里斯托弗-威尔克声称，这种植物通常被认为是 "现代主义室内的植物"。仙人掌也有一套广泛的文化参考。鉴于它与墨西哥和沙漠的联系，它暗示了一个与北欧不同的地方，一个充满阳光并与原始艺术形式相关的地方。在机械化和大规模生产的时代，仙人掌代表着异国的 "他者"，取代了上个世纪的棕榈树（图49）。**

Free-standing potted plants were also added as decorative features in many modernist interiors, both private and public. Single potted plants were undoubtedly sometimes included as afterthoughts - especially when a promotional photograph was needed - but, as in Victorian interiors, they frequently constituted core aesthetic elements in decorative schemes. In the context of modernist architecture, however, there was much less clutter, and greenery was carefully displayed to offset the otherwise stark, minimal spaces it inhabited. As fewer plants were being used, their positioning was all the more powerful and strategic.

**在许多现代主义室内，包括私人和公共场所，独立的盆栽也被添加为装饰性的特征。**毫无疑问，单株盆栽有时是事后的想法--特别是在需要宣传照片的时候--但与维多利亚时期的室内装饰一样，它们经常构成装饰方案的核心审美元素。然而，在现代主义建筑的背景下，杂乱无章的东西要少得多，绿色植物被小心翼翼地展示出来，以抵消它所居住的严酷的、最小的空间。由于使用的植物较少，它们的定位就更加有力和具有战略性。

**Books on the new interior illustrated inside spaces from all over the world, both private and public, many of which contained plants and flowers.** Herbert Hoffmann's Modern Interiors in Europe and America of 1930, for example, included, among many others, an image of a Parisian hotel's entrance hall designed by Pierre Chareau, in which a potted dracaena was positioned on a shelf above a radiator; one of a bedroom in a villa on the French Riviera designed by Georges Djo-Bourgeois and his wife, Elise Bourgeois, which featured a vase of daisies on a chest of drawers; and an image of a hallway in a Dortmund building designed by Emil Pole, which featured a large rubber plant on a side table. 27

**有关新室内装饰的书籍介绍了世界各地的内部空间，包括私人和公共空间，其中许多都有植物和花卉。**例如，赫伯特-霍夫曼（Herbert Hoffmann）在1930年出版的《欧洲和美国的现代室内装饰》（Modern Interiors in Europe and America）一书中，有一幅由皮埃尔-哈罗（Pierre Chareau）设计的巴黎酒店入口大厅的图片，其中一盆龙脑香被摆放在散热器上方的架子上。一幅是乔治-德约-布尔乔亚和他的妻子埃莉斯-布尔乔亚设计的法国里维埃拉别墅的卧室，其中抽屉上有一个雏菊花瓶；还有一幅是埃米尔-波尔设计的多特蒙德建筑的走廊，其中边桌上有一个大的橡胶植物。27

The stands and pots that contained indoor plants also exercised the minds of designers in the inter-war years. For instance, the craftsman and metalworker Louis Dalbet collaborated with the architect Bernard Bijvoet to create striking metal containers of varying heights for Pierre Chareau's Mason de Verre (1932), which was designed for the fashionable Parisian gynecologist Jean Dalsace. 28 Grouped together into clusters, the plants in these containers provided a contrast to the geometrical regularity of the house. One group of potted plants, which included a large dracaena and a weeping fig, was positioned just inside the large glazed window at the front of the house.

装载室内植物的支架和花盆在战时也锻炼了设计师的思维。例如，工匠和金属工人路易斯-达尔贝与建筑师伯纳德-比伊沃特合作，为皮埃尔-哈罗的 "绿园"（1932年）设计了引人注目的不同高度的金属容器，这是为时尚的巴黎妇科医生让-达尔塞斯设计的。28 这些容器中的植物被组合成群，与房子的几何规则性形成了对比。有一组盆栽，包括一株大龙脑香和一株垂枝无花果，被放置在房子前面的大玻璃窗内。

As was the case with growing plants, arrangements of cut flowers in modernist interiors were generally restrained and inconspicuous. That was largely a result of the strong influence of Japan, mentioned in Chapter 2. Frank Lloyd Wright had been among the first to advocate arranging flowers in the Japanese (ikebana) stvle. In his home in Oak Park, for example, he included what he described as a weed holder', which he had designed himself and in which he had placed a single birch branch. It was a form of decoration that he repeated in several of his buildings, including the Martin House in Buffalo (1904). While bunches of flowers in vases very often denoted bourgeois domesticity, because the pared-down arrangements of modernism were less flamboyant than their more ostentatious Victorian antecedents, they were apparently less likely to be associated with social aspiration.

与种植植物的情况一样，现代主义室内的切花布置一般都很节制，不显眼。这主要是由于第二章中提到的日本的强烈影响。弗兰克-劳埃德-赖特是最早提倡以日本（ikebana）的方式插花的人之一。例如，在他位于橡树园的家中，他包括一个他称之为杂草架的东西，这是他自己设计的，他在其中放置了一根白桦树枝。这是一种装饰形式，他在他的一些建筑中重复使用，包括水牛城的马丁大厦（1904）。**虽然花瓶中的花束经常表示资产阶级的家庭生活，但由于现代主义的精简安排没有维多利亚时代的那种浮夸，它们显然不太可能与社会愿望联系在一起。**

Whether suggested by designers or introduced by inhabitants, flower arrangements, used sparingly, became a regular feature in modernist interiors. They appeared in several of the houses on the Weissenhof Estate, including those designed by Rading, Frank and Gropius. As we have seen, they were usually the only decorative item admitted, their link to nature distancing them from the numerous non-natural bibelots used in Victorian interiors. A photograph of Marianne Harnischmacher in the living room of her 1932 house in Wiesbaden, designed by Marcel Breuer, depicts her sitting reading next to a table on which stands a vase filled with an arrangement of twigs and branches. Even the interior of the German airship Graf Zeppelin, designed by Bernhard Pankok in 1928, included a vase of roses placed on a side table in an attempt to make the space look homely and to relax its fearful passengers (fig. 50).

**无论是设计师的建议还是居民的介绍，插花都是现代主义室内的一个常规特征，但使用量不大。**它们出现在魏森霍夫庄园的一些房屋中，包括那些由拉丁、弗兰克和格罗皮乌斯设计的房屋。正如我们所看到的，它们通常是唯一被接受的装饰品，它们与自然的联系使它们与维多利亚时期室内使用的大量非自然的小摆设相区别。Marianne Harnischmacher在她1932年由Marcel Breuer设计的威斯巴登房子的客厅里的一张照片，描述了她坐在桌子旁边阅读，桌子上放着一个花瓶，花瓶里插满了树枝和灌木。**即使是伯恩哈德-潘科克在1928年设计的德国飞艇格拉夫-齐柏林号的内部，也有一个放在边桌上的玫瑰花瓶，试图让空间看起来像家一样，让恐惧的乘客放松下来（图50）。**

Through the inter-war years in both Europe and the United States, the fashion for flower arranging in the Japanese style was disseminated to an audience of amateur female home-makers through home-making advice books. In 1929 Anne Lamplugh illustrated arrangements of horse chestnut and other blossoming branches.39 'Just three sprays of blossom make a very lovely vase if arranged in a modification of the Japanese manner', she explained. She continued: 'The most beautiful results are produced with the slightest materials', while suggesting that 'an even more modified application of this Japanese effect can be obtained by using one branch of blossom wedged among stones in a large dish, and stood upon a low stool in a corner, or in the angle formed by some piece of furniture and the wall'3° Echoing Frank Lloyd Wright, the fashionable and highly authoritative English flower arranger Constance Spry offered similar advice in her book How To Do the Flowers (1938), explaining that 'decorative effect may be achieved with simple materials, with a few leaves and grasses or weeds'3 The anonymous author of The Home of Today of the same year, an advice book published by the Daily Express newspaper, also declared that 'It would be a good thing if we would take lessons from the Japanese and not crowd our flower vases or mix our colours!32 In 1947 the writers of an American publication on the same theme claimed that 'the type of flower arrangement which may justly be defined as "modern" is a hybrid resulting directly from the East and the unfettered, robust, colourful arrangements of the West', implying that by the post-war years modernism had met decoration half way, and the result was a compromise between Eastern and Western aesthetic principles. 33

在战时的欧洲和美国，日本风格的插花时尚通过家庭制作建议书传播给了业余女性家庭制造者。1929年，安妮-兰普勒（Anne Lamplugh）对七叶树和其他开花树枝的摆设进行了说明。39她解释说："如果按照日本的方式摆设，只需三枝花就能成为一个非常可爱的花瓶"。她继续说。她继续说："用最轻微的材料就能产生最美丽的效果"，同时建议 "对这种日本效果进行更多的修改，可以用一枝花夹在大盘子里的石头中，放在角落里的矮凳上，或者放在一些家具和墙壁形成的角度里，就能获得这种效果 "3。与弗兰克-劳埃德-赖特相呼应的是，时尚的、极具权威性的英国插花师康斯坦斯-斯普里在她的《如何插花》（1938年）一书中提出了类似的建议，她解释说，"用简单的材料，用一些树叶和草或野草就可以达到装饰效果。"31 同年，《每日快报》出版的建议书《今日之家》的匿名作者也宣布，"如果我们能向日本人学习，不要把花瓶挤在一起，不要把颜色搞混，那是一件好事。 32 1947年，美国一本关于同一主题的出版物的作者声称，"可以合理地定义为 "现代 "的插花类型是直接从东方和西方不受约束的、强壮的、色彩丰富的安排中产生的混合体"，这意味着到了战后，现代主义已经与装饰相遇，结果是东方和西方审美原则之间的妥协。33

Although the indoor planting and flower-arranging styles of the Victorians and modernists differed dramatically, the Victorians linking nature directly to God while the modernists exploited its aesthetic properties, both groups shared a belief in the power of nature to bring additional life into spaces that were otherwise conceived, made and inhabited by human beings alone. In modernist buildings, nature was used strategically to erode the distinctions between inside and outside and thereby liberate interiors from all trace of enclosed domesticitv. At the same time, by softening indoor spaces, providing a form of decoration and undermining the mechanistic model of modernism, some modernists were also reclaiming the domestic interior. That seeming tension was visible in several iconic modernist buildings, not least the subject of the next chapter, the house that Ludwig Mies van der Rohe built for the Tugendhat family in Brno.

虽然维多利亚时代和现代派的室内种植和插花风格有很大的不同，**维多利亚时代将自然直接与上帝联系在一起，而现代派则利用其美学特性，但这两个群体都相信自然的力量可以为空间带来更多的生命，否则这些空间只能由人类构思、制造和居住。**在现代主义建筑中，**自然被战略性地用来侵蚀内部和外部之间的区别**，从而将室内从所有封闭的家庭痕迹中解放出来。同时，通过软化室内空间，提供一种装饰形式，并破坏现代主义的机械模式，一些现代主义者也在重新获得家庭内部。这种看似紧张的关系在一些标志性的现代主义建筑中是可见的，尤其是下一章的主题，路德维希-密斯-凡-德-罗为布尔诺的图根哈特家族建造的房子。

As explained in the previous chapter, in order to escape the enclosed, inward-looking, symbol-laden interior that had defined Victorian domesticity, the designers of the inside spaces of inter-war modernist dwellings pursued a set of innovative formal and spatial strategies. Though there were tensions, plants and flowers often played a key role in that process. Whether they were included, consciously or subconsciously, to demonstrate a level of continuity with nineteenth-century domesticity, or whether they were part of the desire to create a new aesthetic language for the modern dwelling, is up for debate. Most accounts of inter-war architectural modernism have ignored their presence in favour of narratives that have foregrounded aesthetic formalism, technological innovation and socio-political ambitions.? Some modernist buildings were openly declared by their inhabitants to be difficult to live in - Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House (1945-51) in Illinois, and Le Corbusier's Villa Savoye (1928-31) in Poissy, France, come to mind - while others were reportedly easier to inhabit. Depending on the circumstances, the presence of plants either added to the difficulty or alleviated it.

正如前一章所解释的那样，为了摆脱维多利亚时代家庭生活的封闭、内向、充满符号的内部空间，战时现代主义住宅内部空间的设计师们追求了一系列创新的形式和空间策略。尽管存在着紧张关系，但植物和花卉在这一过程中经常扮演着关键角色。它们是否被有意识地或下意识地包括在内，以显示与19世纪家庭生活的某种程度的连续性，或者它们是否是为现代住宅创造一种新的美学语言的愿望的一部分，都有待讨论。**大多数关于战时建筑现代主义的描述都忽略了它们的存在，而倾向于强调美学形式主义、技术创新和社会政治野心的叙述**。一些现代主义建筑被其居民公开宣称难以居住--路德维希-密斯-凡-德-罗在伊利诺伊州的Farnsworth House（1945-51）和勒-柯布西耶在法国Poissy的Villa Savoye（1928-31）就是其中之一，而其他建筑据说更容易居住。根据不同的情况，植物的存在要么增加了难度，要么减轻了难度。

As well as developing new housing schemes for the working classes, many modernist architects also created residences for wealthy middle-class clients who sought a modern lifestyle free from possessions and clutter. Those progressive clients aspired to a liberated existence that focused on an outward orientation and a sense of escape from the claustrophobia and enclosure associated with the past. Several of these dwellings contained natural elements. One such was Mies van der Rohe's Villa Tugendhat in Brno in the modern Czech Republic, built between 1929 and 1930 (and extensively restored between 2010 and 2012), as the family home of Fritz and Greta Tugendhat.

除了为工人阶级开发新的住房计划外，许多现代主义建筑师还为富裕的中产阶级客户创造了住宅，他们寻求一种没有财产和杂乱的现代生活方式。这些进步的客户渴望一种自由的生活，注重外向性和摆脱与过去相关的幽闭恐惧症和封闭感。这些住宅中有几个含有自然元素。其中之一是密斯-凡德罗在现代捷克共和国布尔诺的图根哈特别墅，建于1929年至1930年（在2010年至2012年期间进行了广泛的修复），是弗里茨和格雷塔-图根哈特的家庭住宅。

Mies's villa has been seen by many architectural historians as a supremely successful example of a residential structure that allowed space to flow uninterrupted; that encouraged an idea of modern family life that did not, at least on one of its floors, require a set of self-contained rooms; and that achieved these goals using advanced technologies and modern materials.3 Much attention has also been paid to the architect's inclusion of rich, highly textured materials - onyx, travertine and a variety of exotic woods - which have been understood as markers of the modern luxury deemed appropriate in that middle-class setting.+ They can also be understood as representations of the natural world in a building largely constructed from the non-natural, hard materials of modern industry - steel, plate glass and concrete among them.

许多建筑历史学家认为密斯的别墅是一个极其成功的住宅建筑范例，它允许空间不受干扰地流动；它鼓励现代家庭生活的理念，至少在其中一个楼层不需要一套独立的房间；它使用先进的技术和现代材料实现这些目标。建筑师将丰富的、高质感的材料--玛瑙、洞石和各种异国情调的木材--纳入其中，这也被理解为现代奢华的标志，被认为适合中产阶级的环境。

The fact that Mies chose the site carefully has received much comment, and the sloping garden that lies behind the house has been described as a dramatic setting for the striking, modern statement at its summit (fig. 51).5 Less has been said, however, about the deliberately engineered continuities between nature and the built structure, about the fact that tamed nature, in the form of the cultivated flower beds immediately outside the building, gave way to a wilder version of nature in the form of trees and bushes as one moved away from the villa to the periphery of the garden (fig. 52). That gradual shift from tamed to wild suggests a carefully controlled transition from culture to nature that reinforced the close relationship between them.

密斯精心选址的事实得到了很多评论，房子后面的斜坡花园被描述为一个戏剧性的环境，在它的顶点有一个引人注目的现代声明（图51）。**这种从驯服到野生的逐渐转变表明，从文化到自然的过渡是经过精心控制的，加强了它们之间的紧密关系。**

p89

Descriptions of the terraces at the Villa Tugendhat have emphasised their role in ensuring that space flows freely from the inside to the outside of the house, and back again, thereby creating an inside/outside ambiguity rather than an enclosed, domestic interior. Much less has been said about how the terraces also provide opportunities for nature - from the climbing greenery covering the pergola that shielded the children's play area on the upper terrace, to that forming a screen behind the curved bench also positioned on that level - to come close to the building. Largely ignored, also, has been the sizable winter garden filled with exotic plants that flanks the entire east side of the building and brings nature right inside it, complementing the exoticism and rich textures of the other natural materials used in the design (fig. 53). A modernist version of the attached Victorian conservatory, it is linked to the house all along one of its sides, which makes it feel particularly closely integrated into the building and renders it more visible from inside. Similarly unnoticed have been the numerous potted plants positioned at strategic interior locations, which are visible in photographs taken throughout the villa's life, and the vases of flowers, also clear in many archive photographs, which were presumably positioned by Greta Tugendhat (or one of the servants). As well as providing an immediate exterior setting for the Villa Tugendhat, nature, in the form of plants and flowers, made a significant contribution to its inside spaces.

对图根哈特别墅的露台的描述强调了它们的作用，即确保空间从屋内自由流动到屋外，然后再返回，从而创造出一种内部/外部的模糊性，而不是一个封闭的家庭内部。关于露台如何为自然提供机会--从覆盖在凉棚上的攀缘绿色植物，遮挡住上层露台上的儿童游戏区，到在该层的弧形长椅后面形成的屏幕--接近建筑的问题，人们说得很少。大多被忽视的是，充满异国情调的大型冬季花园，在建筑的整个东侧，将自然带入其中，与设计中使用的其他自然材料的异国情调和丰富纹理相得益彰（图53）。它是维多利亚时期附属温室的现代主义版本，沿着其中一个侧面与房屋相连，这使它感觉到与建筑的紧密结合，并使它从内部更加明显。同样没有被注意到的是，许多盆栽被放置在室内的战略位置，这些盆栽在整个别墅生活期间的照片中都可以看到，还有花瓶，在许多档案照片中也很清楚，这些花瓶大概是由Greta Tugendhat（或其中一个仆人）放置的。除了为图根哈特别墅提供直接的外部环境外，以植物和花卉形式出现的大自然也为其内部空间做出了重要贡献。

p90

The functions and meanings of the nature in and around the Villa Tugendhat are more difficult to uncover, however. On one level nature was clearly used to reinforce the novel spatial strategies that enabled this remarkable architectural structure to repudiate the past. On another, perhaps, it served to consolidate the villa's relationship with the past and to introduce into it a degree of conventional middle-class domesticity.

然而，Tugendhat别墅内和周围的自然环境的功能和意义更难发现。在一个层面上，自然显然被用来加强新的空间策略，使这个非凡的建筑结构能够否定过去。在另一个层面上，也许它有助于巩固别墅与过去的关系，并在一定程度上引入传统的中产阶级家庭生活。

The Villa Tugendhat has been extensively documented and analysed by architectural historians, partly because, in spite of its rich history, it still exists relatively intact." Also, countless archive photographs of the villa exist, from those taken by Rudolf de Sandalo in 1930, the year of its completion, to others taken following its restoration in 2012. For the most part, those photographs are unpeopled studies in architectural form. The only exception is a set of photographs taken by Fritz Tugendhat between 1930 and 1938, which depict members of the family in the villa's spaces and communicate a sense of family life as it was lived in them.? The more formal photographic studies of the villa reinforce what have usually been seen as its most innovative features: its dramatic use of the open plan (in the middle floor); the strong sense of spatial continuity between inside and outside; and the importance of spatial flexibility manifested in the inclusion of movable screens and fabrics that could be used to create a variety of intimate private spaces as required.

建筑历史学家对图根哈特别墅进行了广泛的记录和分析，部分原因是，尽管它有着丰富的历史，但它仍然相对完整地存在着"。此外，该别墅还有无数的档案照片，从1930年完工时由鲁道夫-德-桑达罗拍摄的照片，到2012年修复后拍摄的其他照片。在大多数情况下，这些照片都是对建筑形式的无人研究。唯一的例外是弗里茨-图根哈特（Fritz Tugendhat）在1930年至1938年间拍摄的一组照片，这些照片描绘了别墅空间中的家庭成员，并传达了一种家庭生活的感觉，因为它是生活在其中的。对别墅进行的更正式的摄影研究加强了通常被视为其最创新的特点：它对开放计划的戏剧性使用（在中间楼层）；内部和外部之间强烈的空间连续性感；以及空间灵活性的重要性，体现在包括可移动的屏幕和织物，可根据需要用来创造各种亲密的私人空间。

The concepts of fluidity of space and transparency have been fundamental to understanding the Villa Tugendhat. They contribute to the idea that the architect wanted to design an interior that could not be defined merely as a series of rooms (at least on one floor). This strategy was facilitated by his decision to construct the building around a series of steel columns supporting a steel frame, rather than on weight-bearing walls.& The columns liberated the interior and exterior walls from their supporting function, allowing the inclusion of expanses of plate glass which, in turn, let in large amounts of light. A structural, engineering focus has dominated most analyses of the building, and many of its innovative technological features have been discussed at length, from the huge electrically controlled opening window in the living area to the use of exchanged air for heating and cooling its inside spaces. There have also been accounts of the furniture, much of which was designed with open steel frames so as not to block the eye as it took in the villa's sophisticated and complex interior spaces.

空间的流动性和透明度的概念一直是理解图根哈特别墅的基础。它们促成了这样一个想法：建筑师想要设计一个不能仅仅被定义为一系列房间的内部（至少在一层）。他决定围绕一系列支撑钢框架的钢柱而不是承重墙来建造该建筑，这促进了这一策略的实施。& 柱子将内外墙从其支撑功能中解放出来，允许加入大面积的平板玻璃，这反过来又让大量的光线进入。对该建筑的分析主要集中在结构和工程方面，对其许多创新的技术特点也进行了详细的讨论，从起居室的巨大电控开窗到使用交换空气来加热和冷却内部空间。还有一些关于家具的描述，大部分家具都是用开放式的钢架设计的，以便在欣赏别墅复杂的内部空间时不至于阻挡视线。

p91

An architecturally, technically, structurally and materially oriented account of the spatial configuration of the Villa Tugendhat is not the only way in which the inside spaces of this complex dwelling can be read and understood. Nor, indeed, was Mies van der Rohe its only creator. Its softer, more portable and ephemeral features - the textured materials, the textiles, the views outside, the play of light and shadow on its surfaces, the plants - also contributed significantly to its spatial and psychological novelty and sophistication. They were the results of various creative inputs: those of the architect; those of the designer of its textiles and colour scheme, Lilly Reich (fig. 54);° those of its garden designer, Markéta Roderová-Müllerová; and those of its inhabitants between 1930 and 1938, the members of the Tugendhat family. Given their relative instability and, sometimes, immateriality, the roles of the softer, transient aspects of the interior are inevitably harder to pin down. Arguably, the hard and the soft strategies worked together to reinforce the radical spatial ambitions of the architect and to provide a level of ambiguity regarding the villa's domestic character.

从建筑上、技术上、结构上和材料上对图根哈特别墅的空间配置进行说明，并不是阅读和理解这个复杂住宅内部空间的唯一方式。事实上，密斯-凡-德-罗也不是其唯一的创造者。它更柔和、更易携带和短暂的特点--有质感的材料、纺织品、外面的景色、表面的光影游戏、植物--也对其空间和心理上的新颖性和复杂性做出了重大贡献。它们是各种创造性投入的结果：建筑师的投入；纺织品和色彩方案设计师莉莉-赖希的投入（图54）；花园设计师马尔凯塔-罗德洛娃-穆勒洛娃的投入；以及1930年至1938年期间的居民，图根哈特家族成员的投入。鉴于其相对的不稳定性，有时甚至是非物质性，室内柔软的、短暂的方面的作用不可避免地难以确定。可以说，软硬兼施的策略共同加强了建筑师的激进空间野心，并为别墅的家庭特征提供了一定程度的模糊性。

Located at Schwarzfeldgasse 45, the Villa Tugendhat sat, and still sits, on a suburban road on the outskirts of Brno, adjacent to several large, opulent, nineteenth-century, middle-class villas. Only one of its three levels can be seen from the street. The façade is covered in white stucco and features a sequence of opaque glazed windows, surrounded by metal frames. It curves round into a semi-circle at its west end. Today, three plants in square planters sit outside the glazed drum that conceals the entrance, softening the industrial severity of the standardised metal-framed panels of opal glass - materials that Mies transferred into his residential dwelling from the commercial arenas of store displays and exhibition spaces. A double-door garage is also visible at street level The most striking feature of the villa, seen from that angle, is the void between the entrance drum and the garage, through which a framed view of Brno can be glimpsed. An exterior terrace runs from the front to the rear of the villa on that level, helping to emphasise its strong horizontality.

图根哈特别墅位于Schwarzfeldgasse 45号，现在仍然位于布尔诺郊区的一条郊区道路上，与几座大型的、富丽堂皇的、十九世纪的中产阶级别墅毗邻。从街上只能看到它三层中的一层。外墙用白色灰泥覆盖，有一排不透明的玻璃窗，周围有金属框架。它在西端弯曲成一个半圆形。今天，三个方形花盆中的植物坐落在掩盖入口的玻璃鼓外面，软化了标准化的乳白色玻璃金属框架面板的工业强度--这些材料是密斯从商店展示和展览空间的商业领域转移到他的住宅中的。从这个角度看，别墅最引人注目的特点是入口鼓和车库之间的空隙，通过它可以瞥见布尔诺的框架景观。在这个层面上，一个外部露台从别墅的前面延伸到后面，有助于强调其强烈的水平性。

In 1930, on walking from the terrace through the concealed entrance behind the drum, the visitor entered a vestibule that featured a tiled floor of Italian travertine, strikingly marked with fibrous patterning, and a ceiling-to-floor dark palisander door positioned alongside a set of four wooden panels. A row of potted mother-in-law's tongues (modernist favourites) sat on a small travertine shelf fixed to the wall to the right of the vestibule. The small, regularly positioned plants with their sharply defined forms led the visitor's eye to the entrance door, in front of which two tubular-steel-framed cantilevered chairs were combined with a small side table to form a waiting area for guests.

1930年，从露台上走过鼓后面的隐蔽入口，游客进入一个前庭，前庭的特点是铺着意大利石灰华的地板，上面有醒目的纤维状图案，还有一扇从天花板到地板的深色棕榈木门，旁边有一组四块木板。一排盆栽的婆婆丁（现代派的最爱）放在固定在前庭右侧墙上的石灰华小架子上。这些小型的、有规律的植物以其鲜明的形式将游客的视线引向入口处，在入口处，两把管状钢架悬臂椅与一张小边桌组合在一起，形成一个等待客人的区域。

To the left, at the top of the staircase leading to the floor below, a complex set of planes, surfaces, forms, materials and spaces converged. To add to that complexity, one of the internal, chromed-steel-covered columns passed through the midst of that convergence. The meeting point of the horizontal floor, which stopped sharply at a right angle as the stairwell fell away beneath it, and the vertical column was made even more complex by its proximity to the end point of the glazed drum and the presence of a rail, made of two horizontal rows of steel bars, that acted as protection from the otherwise open stairwell. An early photograph depicts a potted maple strategically placed on the floor at the point where all those elements met, softening the hard geometry and surrounding materials but also, arguably, providing a visual resolution to, or perhaps a distraction from, the multiple materials and the spatial complexity of the verticals, horizontals, curves, straight lines, masses and voids that came together at that point (fig. 55). The maple in question was fairly large. Its soft full leaves and loosely defined form provided a counterpoint to the formal complexity of what had undoubtedly been an architectural challenge. What may have seemed a minor addition (even an afterthought) already suggests how nature was being used in the villa as a means of solving complex visual problems and of enhancing the building's architectural formalism. In recognition of its architectural and compositional importance, a similar plant was positioned in the same place in the restored villa in 2012 (fig. 56).

在左边，在通往下面楼层的楼梯顶端，一组复杂的平面、表面、形式、材料和空间汇聚在一起。为了增加这种复杂性，其中一根内部的镀铬钢柱穿过了这种交汇的中间。水平地板与垂直柱子的交汇点，因其靠近玻璃鼓的端点，以及由两排水平钢筋组成的栏杆的存在而变得更加复杂，这两排钢筋起到了保护开放楼梯的作用。一张早期的照片描述了在所有这些元素的交汇点上，一盆盆的枫树被战略性地放在地板上，软化了坚硬的几何形状和周围的材料，但也可以说，为多种材料和垂直、水平、曲线、直线、质量和空隙的空间复杂性提供了一个视觉解决方案，或者说是分散了它们的注意力（图 55 ）。所述的枫树相当大。它柔软饱满的叶子和松散的形式，为毫无疑问的建筑挑战的形式复杂性提供了一个对立面。这似乎是一个小的补充（甚至是一个事后的想法），已经表明了自然在别墅中是如何被用作解决复杂的视觉问题和加强建筑的形式主义的手段。由于认识到其在建筑和构图上的重要性，2012年在修复后的别墅中，在同样的位置上也放置了类似的植物（图56）。

One wonders who put the plant there in 1930. Did the architect see its presence as important? Did the photographer, de Sandalo, feel it was a photogenic requirement? Or did a member of the Tugendhat family feel that it provided a picturesque punctuation mark that was needed in that specific location? On one level, given that interiors are always put together by multiple agents, those questions are irrelevant. What is important, rather, is to recognise the maple's primarily formal function in that architectural and interior setting. Not only did it reinforce the spatial strategies at play, it also added texture, color and decoration to the interior. It may also have brought a level of conventional domesticity into that otherwise technologically progressive space.

人们不禁要问，1930年是谁把这个工厂放在那里的。建筑师是否认为它的存在很重要？是摄影师德-桑达罗觉得它是一个上镜的要求吗？还是Tugendhat家族的某个成员觉得它提供了一个风景如画的标点符号，在那个特定的地方是需要的？从某种程度上说，鉴于室内装修总是由多个代理人共同完成的，这些问题并不重要。重要的是，要认识到枫树在那个建筑和室内环境中的主要形式功能。它不仅加强了空间策略的作用，还为室内增添了纹理、色彩和装饰。它也可能为这个技术进步的空间带来了一定程度的传统家庭氛围。

Although it would have been structurally possible, the top floor of the villa was not designed on an open plan. It consisted, rather, of a set of private spaces - bedrooms for the Tugendhat family and the children's nursemaid. There was little that was radical about those spaces. Instead they were presented as conventional private rooms such as could have been found in any dwelling of the era. The rooms were particularly light and bright, however, and contained some very novel items of furniture, again made of exotic woods. They were designed by Mies, but undoubtedly with some assistance from Lilly Reich, who worked in his office at that time on his designs for furniture. 1 The windowsill of Fritz Tugendhat's room hosted a row of three small succulents of different types. They provided a touch of exoticism, as well as emphasising and reinforcing the role played by the large plate-glass window that framed the view of the garden outside. That frame helped both to dramatise the exterior view and to create a sense of inside- outside continuity, reinforcing the fact that Mies designed the villa from the inside out, rather than from the façade in.

尽管在结构上是可行的，但别墅的顶层并没有设计成开放的平面。相反，它由一组私人空间组成--图根哈特家的卧室和孩子的保姆。这些空间没有什么激进之处。相反，它们被表现为传统的私人房间，如在那个时代的任何住宅中都可以找到。然而，这些房间特别明亮，并包含一些非常新颖的家具，也是由异国木材制成。它们是由密斯设计的，但无疑得到了莉莉-赖希的一些帮助，她当时在他的办公室里为他的家具设计工作。1 弗里茨-图根哈特房间的窗台摆放着一排不同类型的小肉植物。它们提供了一丝异国情调，同时也强调和加强了大型平板玻璃窗的作用，该窗将外面的花园景色框住。这个框架既有助于突出外部景观，又有助于创造一种内部和外部的连续性，加强了密斯从内到外设计别墅的事实，而不是从外墙开始。

The room led on to a terrace where more plants were in evidence, acting as transitions to those in the garden beyond. The indoor examples helped to initiate the movement from tamed to wild nature that has already been mentioned as a feature of the garden, and to link a private room intended for sleep and study to the world outside. In 2012, three small pointed succulents of the same species were positioned on the windowsill, suggesting, once again, that the role of plants in that location was still regarded as significant. Greta Tugendhat's room, which was next door, also led onto the terrace, and it too had windows that framed the striking natural scene outside. A small vase of flowers adorns a tubular- steel side table in an early photograph of the room. In 2012 a larger equivalent was added, undoubtedly to soften the otherwise hard materials in a space intended for habitation by a woman.

这个房间通向一个露台，那里有更多的植物，作为与花园中的植物之间的过渡。**室内的例子帮助启动了从驯服到野生自然的运动，这已经作为花园的一个特点被提到，并将一个用于睡眠和学习的私人房间与外面的世界联系起来**。**2012年，三株相同品种的小尖肉质植物被放置在窗台上，再次表明植物在该位置的作用仍然被认为是重要的。**格丽塔-图根哈特（Greta Tugendhat）的房间就在隔壁，也通向露台，它也有窗户，框住了外面引人注目的自然景观。在该房间的一张早期照片中，一个小花瓶装饰着一张管状钢制边桌。2012年，这里增加了一个更大的对等物，无疑是为了软化这个供女性居住的空间里的其他硬材料。

Descending the staircase to the floor below, the full impact of open planning became immediately apparent as an open space measuring 80 by 55 feet came into view (fig. 57). With the exception of the kitchen and the staff's living quarters, situated at the northwest end of the villa, the middle floor consisted of a single open living space. It was an area for family conversations, dining, entertainment, leisure and social interaction. Specific areas were partly defined by flexible textile screens." The furniture was also positioned to support particular activities. The main furniture groupings included a round reception table with four specially designed tubular-steel-framed chairs at the entrance to the living space in front of a light wall; three Barcelona chairs (as they have come to be known) and a matching ottoman (all 1929), and three so-called Tugendhat chairs arranged around a Tugendhat coffee table (all 1930) and positioned next to a Moroccan onyx screen in the main living area (fig. 58); a dining area with an expandable rosewood table and Brno chairs (1930), enveloped by an enormous semi-circular Makassar ebony screen that echoed the form of the bench outside on the terrace;

沿着楼梯下到下面的楼层，随着一个80x55英尺的开放空间映入眼帘，开放式规划的全部影响立即显现出来（图57）。除了位于别墅西北端的厨房和工作人员的生活区外，中间一层由一个开放的生活空间组成。它是一个用于家庭谈话、用餐、娱乐、休闲和社会交往的区域。特定的区域部分由灵活的纺织屏风界定"。家具的定位也是为了支持特定的活动。主要的家具组合包括：一张圆形接待桌和四把特别设计的管状钢架椅，位于生活空间的入口处，前面是一面光墙；三把巴塞罗那椅（后来被称为）和一把配套的长椅（均为1929年），以及三把所谓的图根哈特椅，围绕着图根哈特咖啡桌（均为1930年），位于主生活区的摩洛哥玛瑙屏幕旁边（图）。58）；用餐区有一张可扩展的红木桌子和布尔诺椅子（1930年），被一个巨大的半圆形马卡萨乌木屏风所包围，与外面露台上的长椅形状相呼应。

a library area with a pigskin-covered sofa (1930) and three tubular-steel framed Brno chairs (1930) arranged around a bridge table; and a rear living area with a large desk and two cantilevered chairs with armrests (fig. 59). A single metal-framed chaise longue (1931), upholstered in red fabric, was also included. Accompanied by a small side table, it offered an opportunity for private contemplation or quiet reading.

书房区有一张猪皮沙发（1930年）和三把管状钢架布尔诺椅（1930年），围绕着桥桌排列；后部生活区有一张大桌子和两把带扶手的悬臂椅（图59）。此外，还包括一张金属框架的贵妃椅（1931年），用红色织物做装饰。伴随着一张小边桌，它为私人沉思或安静阅读提供了机会。

p97

Those furniture groupings were placed on a neutral white linoleum floor and, with the assistance of several rugs, defined the main settings. The permeability of the border between the interior space and the outside world was reinforced on the south side by full-length windows, giving an impression that the interior extended beyond its actual physical boundary. The metal frames of the huge plate-glass windows controlled that view as if it were a set of large pictures on the wall. To render the effect of transparency even more dramatic, the two middle windows could be made to slide down into a groove that reached into the floor below, thereby creating real spatial continuity between the inside and the outside. Sitting inside, the inhabitants had a sense of being outside. Transparency became translucency when the vast see-through curtains were pulled across the picture windows. Opaque curtains on rails were also used to hide the winter garden from view, while another could be pulled across in front of the piano to turn the library area into a more private, contained space. 12

这些家具组合被放置在一个中性的白色油毡地板上，在几块地毯的帮助下，确定了主要的设置。室内空间和外部世界之间的边界的渗透性在南侧通过全长的窗户得到了加强，给人的印象是室内延伸到其实际的物理边界之外。巨大的平板玻璃窗的金属框架控制着这一景观，就像墙上的一组大型图片一样。为了使透明的效果更加引人注目，中间的两扇窗户可以滑落到下面的地板上，从而在内部和外部之间创造真正的空间连续性。坐在里面的居民有一种在外面的感觉。当巨大的透视窗帘被拉过图片窗时，透明度就变成了半透明。栏杆上的不透明窗帘也被用来遮挡冬季花园的视线，而另一个窗帘可以拉到钢琴前面，将图书馆区域变成一个更加私密、封闭的空间。12

While the uninterrupted views gave the impression of nature penetrating the interior, the winter garden that flanked the entire eastern end of the building literally brought nature inside. Full of exotic potted plants (including a striking cycad visible in archive photographs), luxuriant ferns and several other examples of greenery, which inevitably changed over the years, that huge glass container presented the unruliness of a jungle to those sitting on the chairs facing it. Juxtaposing the calm of the understated and sparsely decorated living space, the visual chaos of those thrusting evergreens was hard for the eye to take in. However, they were contained within glass walls and therefore prevented from invading the serene living area. Yet they were not so much tamed as controlled. Like ferns in a Wardian case in a middle-class nineteenth-century parlour, their link to the wilderness was enjoyed but not permitted to disturb the domestic space they inhabited. One could, however, enter the villa's winter garden and walk among the plants on a little path constructed for that purpose (figs 60 and 61), just as one could go into an attached domestic conservatory of the nineteenth century. This also allowed the plants to be tended, aided by the presence of water in a small pool served by a tap linked to the water supply. The pool added another natural element to the setting, reinforcing nature's presence in the building.

虽然不受干扰的景色给人以自然界渗透到室内的印象，但整个建筑东端两侧的冬季花园实际上是把自然界带进了室内。充满异国情调的盆栽（包括在档案照片中可以看到的引人注目的苏铁）、繁茂的蕨类植物和其他一些绿色植物的例子，这些都不可避免地随着时间的推移而改变，这个巨大的玻璃容器给坐在面对它的椅子上的人带来了丛林的不羁。与低调的、装饰稀少的生活空间的平静相比较，那些刺眼的常绿植物的视觉混乱让人难以接受。然而，它们被控制在玻璃墙内，因此被阻止侵入宁静的生活区。然而，它们与其说是被驯服，不如说是被控制。就像十九世纪中产阶级客厅里的沃迪箱中的蕨类植物一样，人们享受着它们与荒野的联系，但不允许它们干扰所居住的家庭空间。然而，人们可以进入别墅的冬季花园，在专门建造的一条小路上在植物间行走（图60和61），就像人们可以进入十九世纪的附属家庭温室一样。这也使得植物可以得到照料，而一个小水池中的水也为其提供了帮助，水池的水龙头与供水系统相连。这个池子给环境增加了另一个自然元素，加强了自然在建筑中的存在。

The villa's winter garden served many functions. On the simplest level it hid the interior from the street outside. On another it provided an intermediate, or transitional, space between the tamed interior and wild nature outside, reminding us, once again, of the architect's decision to work from the inside outwards. Like the flower garden outside that bordered the façade of the villa, it offered a staging post between the tamed and the wild. It was part of the inside and part of the outside. Full of exotics, in winter it provided a layer of green against the white of the frequently snow-covered garden outside. Like the conservatory attached to the nineteenth-century middle-class home, it brought nature (almost) indoors; indeed, it did so more effectively than the conservatory, because the boundary-free nature of Mies's interior rendered it clearly visible from many positions in the living space, adding strong colour, pattern and texture to that setting. The visual complexity and controlled disorderliness of the plants in the winter garden, which were transformed by light falling on them, were complemented by the rich and seemingly random grain on the onyx wall. In both cases, nature offered Mies an opportunity to introduce decoration and texture into an otherwise minimally ornamented interior space.

别墅的冬季花园有许多功能。在最简单的层面上，它将室内与外面的街道隐藏起来。在另一个层面上，它为驯服的内部和外面的野生自然提供了一个中间或过渡性的空间，再次提醒我们，建筑师决定从内部向外工作。就像别墅外墙边的花圃一样，它在驯服和野生之间提供了一个驿站。它是内部的一部分，也是外部的一部分。冬天，它充满了异国情调，在外面经常被雪覆盖的白色花园中提供了一层绿色。**就像十九世纪中产阶级住宅的温室一样，它将自然（几乎）带入室内；事实上，它比温室更有效，因为密斯的室内无边界的性质使得它从生活空间的许多位置都能清楚地看到，为该环境添加了强烈的色彩、图案和纹理。**冬季花园中植物的视觉复杂性和可控的无序性，在光线的照射下发生了变化，与玛瑙墙上丰富而看似无序的纹理相得益彰。在这两个案例中，自然为密斯提供了一个机会，将装饰和纹理引入到一个原本装饰性极低的室内空间。

Above all, the plants in the winter garden presented a riotous wall of green (or, rather, a range of greens) in that subtly toned interior. The green was picked up by the leather upholstery on the Barcelona chairs, one row of which sat with their backs to the vegetation. According to Greta's daughter, Daniela, 'Lilly Reich was largely responsible for the choice of colors and fabrics.13 Dominated by shades of white, off-white, black and silver chrome, the palette featured strong colour highlights in the form of the green plants and leather upholstery and the ruby red of the single chaise longue. Greta Tugendhat's flowers also offered temporary dashes of vibrant colour. Along with the multiple woodgrains, the travertine and the onyx, the leaves of the plants also provided pattern as well as texture, which was picked up again by the textile surfaces of the rugs and curtains. With the exception of the oriental rug in the library, which came from the Tugendhats' previous home and which added an obvious level of domesticity, the addition of those patterns and textures was probably Reich's work. The stone in the garden immediately outside the villa contributed to the effect, providing a rougher, untamed texture to join those inside.

最重要的是，冬季花园里的植物在这个低调的室内呈现出一堵喧闹的绿色（或者说，一系列的绿色）。巴塞罗那椅子上的皮革装饰也呈现出这种绿色，其中一排椅子背对着植物。据葛丽泰的女儿丹妮拉说，"莉莉-赖希主要负责颜色和面料的选择。13色调以白色、米白色、黑色和银铬色为主，调色板上的绿色植物和皮革装饰以及单人贵妃椅上的宝石红色都是强烈的色彩亮点。格雷塔-图根哈特（Greta Tugendhat）的花也提供了临时的鲜艳色彩。除了多种木纹、洞石和缟玛瑙之外，植物的叶子也提供了图案和纹理，这一点又被地毯和窗帘的纺织品表面所吸收。除了书房里的东方地毯来自图根达特家的前一个家，它明显增加了家庭氛围，这些图案和纹理的增加可能是赖希的工作。紧挨着别墅外面的花园里的石头也为这种效果做出了贡献，提供了一种更粗糙的、桀骜不驯的质地，与里面的质地结合起来。

The containment of uncontrolled nature achieved by putting plants within a large glass box added an important element to the villa and is one of its most interesting, and perhaps most surprising, features. It is also one of its least documented aspects. Spatially, the winter garden reinforced the sense of ambiguity, permeability and translucency that was so much a part of this novel project, adding another layer to the vista and providing an important bridge to outside. The presence of tamed and semi-tamed nature inside the villa directed the eye to look outwards at nature growing wilder by increments in the near, middle and far distances.

**通过将植物放在一个大的玻璃盒子里，实现了对不受控制的自然的遏制，这为别墅增加了一个重要的元素，也是它最有趣，也许是最令人惊讶的特点之一。**这也是它被记录得最少的方面之一。在空间上，冬季花园加强了模糊性、渗透性和半透明性的感觉，这在这个新颖的项目中是非常重要的一部分，为视野增加了另一个层次，并提供了一个重要的桥梁来连接外部。**别墅内驯服和半驯服的自然的存在，引导人们的目光向外看，在近、中、远的地方，自然的野性逐渐增强。**

Archive images of the Villa Tugendhat show vases of cut flowers placed on a range of surfaces (a practice that continues in the restored building). Although these are the most ephemeral of all the interior components under discussion, they represent another way in which nature was introduced into the villa's inside spaces. They also added a level of domesticity. Greta's daughter has confirmed that her mother brought flowers in from the garden on a regular basis, and that her choices were notable for their modesty. She usually selected small posies rather than the exuberant bunches of flowers one would typically have found in a Victorian parlour.14

**图根哈特别墅的档案图片显示，切花的花瓶放置在一系列的表面上（这种做法在修复后的建筑中继续存在）。虽然这些是我们讨论的所有内部组件中最短暂的，但它们代表了将自然引入别墅内部空间的另一种方式。**它们还增加了一个层次的家庭性。格丽塔的女儿证实，她的母亲经常从花园里带来鲜花，而且她的选择因其谦逊而引人注目。她通常选择小花束，而不是在维多利亚时代的客厅里通常会发现的那种繁华的花束。

Small bowls of roses appear in a number of photographs: one on the tubular-steel-framed table in Greta's bedroom; another on a wooden table in the nursemaid's room; another on a little tubular-steel-framed table to the rear of the dining area; another on the dining table; another on the credenza beside the six Brno chairs; yet another on the sideboard behind the onyx wall; and a larger one on the piano. While they may have been placed there to enhance the picturesque or photogenic nature of the interior, Greta probably included them to introduce an ambiance of domesticity into the otherwise unrelentingly modern space.

一些照片中出现了小碗状的玫瑰花：一个在格丽塔卧室的管状钢架桌子上；另一个在女佣房间的木桌上；另一个在用餐区后面的管状钢架小桌上；另一个在餐桌上；另一个在六把布尔诺椅子旁边的书柜上；还有一个在玛瑙墙后面的餐具柜上；以及钢琴上的一个大碗。虽然它们被放置在那里可能是为了增强室内的风景或拍照的性质，但格丽塔将它们包括在内可能是为了在其他不稳定的现代空间中引入一种家庭氛围。

The exotic plants in the Villa Tugendhat were not the first to have been brought inside a space designed by Mies. In 1927 he had collaborated with Lilly Reich on an interior for the Werkbund exhibition in Stuttgart. Matilda McQuaid has confirmed that 'the official catalogue listed both Reich and Mies as designers! 15 The space became known as the Glass Room because of the extensive use of mirroring on its walls. One of its most interesting features, in the context of this study, was a row of three large potted plants - among them a large rubber plant and a dramatic agave - located on one side of the room, a precursor, without doubt, of the Villa Tugendhat's winter garden. 16 In 1930-31 Mies and Reich worked together again on an exhibition project in Berlin, 'Die Wohnung unserer Zeit' (The Dwelling of Our Time), which featured an ideal living space once again enhanced with potted plants and flowers (fig. 62). Nor was the Villa Tugendhat the last of Mies's buildings to contain plants. The lobby of his later Lake Shore Drive apartments in Chicago (1949-51) also featured several examples (fig. 63).

图根哈特别墅中的奇异植物并不是第一次被带入密斯设计的空间。1927年，他与Lilly Reich合作，为斯图加特的Werkbund展览设计了一个内部空间。Matilda McQuaid证实，"官方目录将Reich和Mies都列为设计师！"。15 **这个空间被称为 "玻璃房"，因为它的墙壁上大量使用了镜子。在这项研究中，它最有趣的特征之一是位于房间一侧的一排三个大型盆栽--其中有一个大型橡胶植物和一个引人注目的龙舌兰，毫无疑问，这是图根哈特别墅冬季花园的前身。**1930-31年，密斯和赖希在柏林的一个展览项目中再次合作，名为 "我们时代的住宅"（Die Wohnung unser Zeit），其特点是再次用盆栽和花卉来加强理想生活空间（图62）。图根哈特别墅也不是密斯最后一个种植植物的建筑。他后来在芝加哥的湖滨路公寓（1949-51）的大厅里也有几个例子（图63）。

p101

While Greta Tugendhat was clear that Reich selected the textiles and the colour scheme for her home, she did not attribute the choice of a conservatory to her. Instead, she explained that her husband was responsible for creating 'a genuine greenhouse in the conservatory. 7 However, although Fritz Tugendhat clearly planted and nurtured its contents, the initial inclusion of the conservatory was not necessarily his idea. Lilly Reich may also have been a key contributor, for the plants can be seen as having a softening and decorative role similar to that of the other aspects for which she was responsible, as well as adding to the exotic effect of the richly textured woods and other natural materials that she almost certainly helped to choose. The green provided by the plants could well have been her idea, too, at least in part.

虽然格雷塔-图根哈特清楚，赖希为她的家选择了纺织品和色彩方案，但她并没有把温室的选择归功于她。相反，她解释说，她的丈夫负责在温室里创造 "一个真正的温室"。7 然而，尽管弗里茨-图根哈特显然种植和培育了其中的内容，但最初加入温室不一定是他的主意。莉莉-赖希可能也是一个关键的贡献者，因为植物可以被视为具有软化和装饰的作用，类似于她负责的其他方面，同时也增加了质地丰富的木材和其他自然材料的异国情调，她几乎肯定帮助选择了这些材料。植物所提供的绿色也很可能是她的主意，至少是部分的。

p102

The use of exotic plants and luxury materials brings one back to the question of conventional domesticity in the context of the Villa Tugendhat. Both Fritz and Greta Tugendhat came from families of wealthy industrialists. Rather than opting for a display of traditional opulence, by employing Mies to design their home they chose a more radical path. However, it appears that the villa did perform the role of home for them during the eight years in which they inhabited it. Greta, for example, claimed that the open plan allowed her both privacy and the possibility of being part of a totality.18 Her decision to include her piano and her oriental rug, as well as her assiduousness in ensuring the continued presence of fresh flowers, suggest that she felt the need to add elements of conventional domesticity to the villa, and found ways of doing so. In addition, even though the pieces themselves were made from tubular-steel frames rather than horse-hair upholstery, the furniture arrangements facilitated family activities and social interaction. Nothing seems to have prevented the Tugendhat parents and children from enjoying family life in their villa, and, indeed, several of its features seem to have supported a traditional domestic existence.

异国植物和奢侈材料的使用使人们回到了图根哈特别墅的传统家庭性问题上。Fritz和Greta Tugendhat都来自富裕的工业家家庭。他们没有选择展示传统的富丽堂皇，而是通过雇佣密斯设计他们的家，选择了一条更激进的道路。然而，在他们居住的八年时间里，这栋别墅似乎确实扮演了家的角色。例如，格丽塔声称，开放式的设计使她既有隐私，又有可能成为整体的一部分。18 她决定将她的钢琴和东方地毯包括在内，并坚持不懈地确保新鲜花卉的存在，这表明她觉得有必要在别墅中加入传统的家庭生活元素，并找到了这样做的方法。此外，尽管这些家具本身是由管状钢架而不是马鬃软垫制成的，但这些家具的安排有利于家庭活动和社会互动。似乎没有什么能阻止Tugendhat家的父母和孩子在他们的别墅里享受家庭生活，事实上，别墅的一些特点似乎也支持了传统的家庭生活。

In the debate about the villa's habitability, or the extent to which it permitted domesticity - a debate initiated as early as November 1931 in the Werkbund's journal, Die Form - the role of the plants and flowers is central. 19 They undoubtedly brought to the interior an exoticism and a sense of bourgeois luxury, both of which had been indicators of nineteenth-century domesticity. In addition to the possible addition of a conservatory, in a nineteenth-century home potted plants would have been distributed freely throughout the living spaces, adding to the sense of clutter, while also, paradoxically, providing a means of knitting everything together visually. In the Villa Tugendhat, in addition to the specimens located near the staircase, on a handful of shelves and on bedroom windowsills, the most dramatic plants were contained behind a large sheet of plate glass. That created a view, observable from many locations in the open living area, that functioned like an enormous painting or cinema screen, bringing tamed nature into the interior, but, at the same time, restraining it and not letting it invade. The glass prevented the family from engaging with the winter garden with any sense other than sight (unless they chose to go inside it), while its dramatic impact added a level of visual theatre to the interior.

在关于别墅的可居住性，或者说它允许家庭生活的程度的辩论中--早在1931年11月就在Werkbund的杂志《Die Form》上开始了辩论--植物和花卉的作用是核心。19 它们无疑给室内带来了异国情调和资产阶级的奢华感，这两者都是19世纪家庭生活的标志。除了可能增加一个温室外，在十九世纪的住宅中，盆栽植物会自由地分布在整个生活空间中，增加了杂乱的感觉，但矛盾的是，也提供了一种手段，在视觉上将所有东西编织在一起。在图根哈特别墅，除了位于楼梯附近、少数几个架子上和卧室窗台上的标本之外，最引人注目的植物被放置在一块大的平板玻璃后面。这创造了一个视野，可以从开放的生活区的许多地方观察到，其功能就像一幅巨大的绘画或电影屏幕，将驯服的自然带入室内，但同时，限制它，不让它入侵。玻璃使家人无法用视觉以外的任何感官来接触冬季花园（除非他们选择进入花园），而其戏剧性的影响为室内增加了一个层次的视觉剧场。

That restraining of nature prevented it from becoming part of the interior itself. However, the fact that family members could open a door and walk directly into the winter garden meant that they could engage directly with it whenever they chose to. There was no longer a sense, as there had been in Victorian homes, that God was present there (though the villa has been described as having a spiritual quality), that the winter garden formed an important element within the children's education. or that it functioned as a marker of social status, yet the proximity to plants, the little path and the small pool of water clearly offered a moment of escape, of contemplation and of calm that undoubtedly enhanced the well- being of visitors to the conservatory and of those seated in the living area.20

这种对自然的束缚使它无法成为室内本身的一部分。然而，家庭成员可以打开一扇门，直接走进冬季花园，这意味着他们可以在任何时候选择直接与它接触。这里不再像维多利亚时代的住宅那样，让人感觉到上帝就在那里（尽管别墅被描述为具有灵性），冬季花园构成了儿童教育的一个重要元素，或者说它是社会地位的一个标志，然而接近植物、小路和小水潭显然提供了一个逃避、沉思和平静的时刻，这无疑提高了温室的访客和坐在生活区的人的幸福感20。

The plants in the Villa Tugendhat served many purposes, therefore. They reinforced the formal and spatial strategies of the architect; they helped the inhabitants to negotiate the spaces; they pinpointed and resolved points of spatial tension; they demarcated boundaries, however permeable; they contributed to the creation of inside/outside ambiguity; and they emphasised the villa's having been designed from the inside out. They were also one of the multiple softening agents used to transform that potentially hard and dehumanised building into a dwelling, even into a home, albeit a modern one; they helped to maintain some continuity with the past; and they offered the possibility of well-being. Finally, they contributed to a sense of the exotic that had distinguished the interiors of wealthy inhabitants for decades.

因此，图**根哈特别墅中的植物有很多作用。它们加强了建筑师的形式和空间策略；它们帮助居民在空间中进行谈判；它们指出并解决了空间紧张点；它们划定了边界，无论如何渗透；它们有助于创造内部/外部的模糊性；它们强调了别墅是由内而外设计的。**它们也是多种软化剂之一，用于将这个潜在的坚硬和非人性化的建筑转化为住宅，甚至转化为一个家，尽管是一个现代的家；它们有助于保持与过去的某种连续性；它们还提供了幸福的可能性。最后，它们促成了一种异国情调，几十年来，这种情调使富裕居民的室内环境与众不同。

While the Villa Tugendhat contained a highly progressive, modernist space rather than a Victorian interior, nature inside helped ease the transition from one to the other. The result was a new model of modern domesticity. In the years after 1945, several European émigré architects took that model across the Atlantic and influenced the indoor spaces of many of the new residences constructed on the west coast of the United States.

**虽然图根哈特别墅包含了一个高度进步的现代主义空间，而不是维多利亚时代的内部，但里面的自然环境有助于缓解从一个到另一个的过渡。其结果是一个现代家庭的新模式。在1945年之后的几年里，一些欧洲移民建筑师将这种模式带到了大西洋彼岸，影响了美国西海岸许多新住宅的室内空间。**

When European architectural modernism spread to the west coast of the United States in the 1920s, it encountered a climate that was warm and dry all year round, with lush vegetation. While the programme of social utopianism, and the alignment with cultural and technological modernity remained in place, many of the private residences that were created in this new setting were heavily influenced by their encounter with nature. As a result of the indoor/outdoor lifestyle made possible by the weather, it became increasingly difficult to differentiate between the two spheres. What constituted inside became less clearly defined, and the close relationship between the garden and the house that Humphry Repton had initiated back in the eighteenth century was dramatically intensified. As a result, a discussion about nature inside in this context becomes, by necessity, a more open one, embracing what, in another context, would have been more clearly the space of the garden.

当欧洲建筑现代主义在20世纪20年代传播到美国西海岸时，它遇到了一个全年温暖干燥、植被茂盛的气候。虽然社会乌托邦主义的方案，以及与文化和技术现代性的一致性仍然存在，但在这个新环境中创建的许多私人住宅都受到了与自然相遇的巨大影响。由于天气使室内/室外的生活方式成为可能，越来越难以区分这两个领域。构成室内的东西变得不那么明确，而汉弗莱-雷普顿早在18世纪就开始的花园和房子之间的密切关系得到了极大的加强。因此，在这种情况下，关于内部自然的讨论必然成为一种更加开放的讨论，包括在另一种情况下更明显的花园的空间。

Modernism was brought to the west coast of the United States by several European émigrés seeking a new life. Among them were the Viennese architects Rudolf Schindler and Richard Neutra. Schindler arrived in southern California in 1921 to work on Frank Lloyd Wright's Hollyhock House for Louise Aline Barnsdall (fig. 64). Neutra, a friend of Schindler's from 1913, also worked for Wright for a short period but, following an Invitation from Schindler, moved to the West Coast in 1925. Neutra's first Projects, which were in landscape design, included a garden for a beach house designed by Schindler for Philip Lovell, and a pergola and wading pool for the Barnsdall house. The Swiss architect Albert Frey, who had previously worked in the office of Le Corbusier, was among the numerous other Europeans who moved to southern California. He arrived in the United States in 1928 and settled in Palm Springs.

现代主义是由几个寻求新生活的欧洲移民带到美国西海岸的。其中有维也纳的建筑师鲁道夫-辛德勒和理查德-诺伊特拉。辛德勒于1921年抵达南加州，为路易斯-艾琳-巴恩斯达尔（Louise Aline Barnsdall）建造弗兰克-劳埃德-赖特的霍利霍克屋（图64）。诺伊特拉是辛德勒1913年的朋友，他也为赖特工作过一段时间，但在辛德勒的邀请下，于1925年搬到了西海岸。诺伊特拉的第一个项目是景观设计，包括为辛德勒为菲利普-洛弗尔设计的海滨别墅的花园，以及为巴恩斯达尔别墅设计的凉棚和涉水池。瑞士建筑师阿尔伯特-弗雷（Albert Frey）曾在勒-柯布西耶（Le Corbusier）的办公室工作过，他是其他众多移居南加州的欧洲人之一。他于1928年抵达美国并在棕榈泉定居。

With the possibility in California of not merely looking at nature outside through plate-glass picture windows (as at the Villa Tugendhat), but rather of actually living outside for much of the year, and, in so doing, taking the inside outside, nature inside took on a new meaning. The model was the Californian ranch house, with its space for outdoor entertaining.? The patio and the garden became outside rooms, the former often furnished almost as if it were inside. In that new domestic scenario, the ways in which plants and flowers were used became highly strategic and the idea of landscape, no longer restricted to the garden area but also part of the inside spaces of the house, became an important component of a new, late-modern language of domesticity.

在加利福尼亚，人们不仅可以通过平板玻璃窗欣赏外面的自然风光（如图根哈特别墅），而且可以在一年中的大部分时间里实际居住在外面，这样一来，就可以把室内的东西搬到室外，室内自然就有了新的含义。模型是加利福尼亚的牧场房屋，它有户外娱乐的空间。**天井和花园成了外面的房间，前者的家具几乎就像里面一样。在这种新的家庭场景中，植物和花卉的使用方式变得非常有策略性，景观的概念不再局限于花园区域，也是房屋内部空间的一部分，成为新的、晚期现代的家庭语言的重要组成部分。**

With its easy access to mountains, deserts and the shoreline, 19205 southern California has been described as 'a bucolic Eden'3 A modernist architectural movement developed there that was 'looser, warmer, more gd hoc' than its European eauivalent. Not only did the Californian climate aclitate outdoor living, it also made it easy to embrace the idea or that Faterior open plan, which could now flow easily into outdoor spaces. That 'frategy had already revealed itself on American soil earlier in the century in the work of Frank Lloyd Wrisht and his Prairie School colleagues, aid In that of members of the American Arts and Crafts movement, including "hartes and Henry Greene, whose Gamble House was described in Chapter a. Following Greene & Greene, Schindler picked up the idea of integrating open sleeping porches into a house when desisning a residence in Kings Road, Los Angeles, which was completed in 1922. The house was built for two couples to live together, sharing a kitchen. Heavily influenced by Japan - as Greene & Greene had been - the outside was welcomed in (and vice versa) through the use of fragile sliding screens made of gypsum board in the rooms that opened onto the rear garden. In turn, the garden was enclosed on three sides by the house and acted as an external room for most of the year. Outdoor fireplaces made that an even more feasible proposition.

19205年的南加州凭借其便捷的山路、沙漠和海岸线，被描述为 "富饶的伊甸园 "3，一场现代主义建筑运动在那里发展起来，比欧洲的同类建筑 "更宽松、更温暖、更有特色"。加利福尼亚的气候不仅有利于户外生活，而且也使人们很容易接受Faterior开放计划的理念，现在可以很容易地流向户外空间。这一策略在本世纪初的美国土地上已经在弗兰克-劳埃德-弗里斯特和他的草原学校同事的作品中显现出来，在美国艺术和手工艺运动成员的作品中，包括 "哈特斯和亨利-格林，他们的甘布尔房子在第一章中已经描述过。这座房子是为两对夫妇共同生活而建造的，共用一个厨房。由于格林&格林公司深受日本的影响，通过在房间里使用石膏板制成的脆弱的滑动屏风来欢迎外面的人进来（反之亦然），这些房间都是通往后花园的。反过来，花园三面都被房子包围着，一年中的大部分时间都作为一个外部房间。室外壁炉使之成为一个更加可行的提议。

Neutra also negotiated the relationships between the insides and outsides of his houses, and cultivated their rapport with nature. Having worked on the Demonstration Health House in Los Angeles (1927-9) for the naturopathic doctor Philip Lovell, who had already employed Schindler, he established his own practice in 1931. Featuring the first use of a steel frame in a domestic project, the Lovell House was a material representation of the doctor's idea that open-air sleeping was linked to healthy living. Vast expanses of glass were used to bring the outside in, and sleeping porches and patios were added to 'extend living outwards! 'We love nature, plants, views, light and air, differently from, and more than, previous generations', Neutra proclaimed, in direct reference to plants particularising the generalised view of nature that had been embraced by the inter-war European architects.6

诺伊特拉还处理了他的房屋内部和外部之间的关系，并培养了他们与大自然的关系。在为自然疗法医生菲利普-洛弗尔（Philip Lovell）设计了洛杉矶的示范健康屋（1927-9）后，他于1931年建立了自己的事务所。洛弗尔之家首次在国内项目中使用了钢架，它是医生的想法的物质体现，即露天睡眠与健康生活有关。大面积的玻璃被用来将外面的光线引入室内，并增加了睡廊和天井，以 "将生活向外延伸！"。诺伊特拉宣称："我们热爱自然、植物、风景、光线和空气，与前几代人不同，也比前几代人更热爱"，直接提到了植物，将战时欧洲建筑师所接受的普遍的自然观具体化。

Thus, when Neutra was commissioned by Grace Miller to build a small house in Palm Springs, which was completed in 1937, his ideas about health, nature and the therapeutic role of architecture were already fully formed (fig. 65). As the house was built in the desert, with a view of mountains, nature played a key role in its conception. As well as working with plants and flowers, Neutra understood nature in an abstract sense as the laws of biology that determine the movements of the body. Miller wanted to use her home as a studio in which to teach the 'Mensendieck System of Functional Exercises", and Neutra was fully aligned with the project from the outset.? His views were rooted in what seemed like a fundamental contradiction - that the body, like architecture, was a machine but that it was also rooted in nature. The resolution of that apparent contradiction lay in his belief in the union of the pastoral ideal and the machine culture, a belief that underpinned American modernism in general. In his 1964 book The Machine In the Garden: Technology and the Pastoral Ideal in America, the historian of technology Leo Marx was to claim that this union characterised the culture of the United States after 1945.8

因此，当诺伊特拉受格雷斯-米勒委托在棕榈泉建造一座小房子，并于1937年完工时，他关于健康、自然和建筑的治疗作用的想法已经完全形成（图65）。由于房子建在沙漠中，可以看到山脉，自然在其概念中发挥了关键作用。**除了与植物和花卉打交道外，诺伊特拉在抽象的意义上将自然理解为决定身体运动的生物学规律。**米勒想把她的家作为一个工作室，在那里教授 "门森迪克功能锻炼系统"，而诺伊特拉从一开始就完全赞同这个项目。他的观点植根于一个看似基本的矛盾--身体，像建筑一样，是一台机器，但它也植根于自然。解决这个明显的矛盾在于他对田园理想和机器文化的结合的信念，这个信念是美国现代主义的普遍基础。在他1964年出版的《花园里的机器》中。技术历史学家利奥-马克思（Leo Marx）在其1964年出版的《花园里的机器：美国的技术和田园理想》一书中声称，这种结合是1945年后美国文化的特点。

In order to integrate it into the landscape, Neutra ensured that the Miller House opened directly onto the desert. A screened patio with a reflecting pool reinforced that link. Miller explained that 'Mr. Neutra was given a clear idea of my preference for taking meals outdoors! The living space was left open, leading onto the studio and the patio. Neutra described the house as 'nature near! ° The landscaping of the garden was also carefully considered by the architect, who planted cacti and desert foliage near to the house to replace the planting that had been lost during its construction. In the garden area he created both 'an idealized desert setting and an oasis', representing, in his words, 'both nature and culture!" To create his desired effect Neutra combined a number of non-indigenous, exotic cacti with native trees and shrubs - among them a smoke tree, a cottonwood tree, desert willows, a mesquite, a range of citrus trees, greasewood bushes, a white oleander, desert verbena and tamarix shrubs. He used a stone walkway to separate the distinct areas. 12 Neutra linked the garden to the inside décor by using colours, including rust, taken from the desert plants in the garden.

为了将其融入景观，诺伊特拉确保米勒住宅直接向沙漠开放。一个带反射池的屏风庭院加强了这种联系。米勒解释说，"诺伊特拉先生清楚地知道我喜欢在户外进餐！"。生活空间是开放的，通向工作室和天井。诺伊特拉将这所房子描述为 "接近自然！"。°花园的景观设计也是建筑师精心考虑的，他在房子附近种植了仙人掌和沙漠中的树叶，以取代在建造过程中失去的植物。在花园区域，他既创造了 "理想化的沙漠环境，又创造了绿洲"，用他的话说，"既代表自然，又代表文化！" 为了创造他所期望的效果，诺伊特拉将一些非本地的外来仙人掌与本地树木和灌木结合起来--其中有一棵烟树、一棵木棉树、沙漠柳树、一棵介壳虫、一系列的柑橘树、油桐树丛、白色夹竹桃、沙漠马鞭草和柽柳灌木。他用一条石板路来分隔不同的区域。诺伊特拉通过使用花园中的沙漠植物的颜色，包括铁锈色，将花园与室内装饰联系起来。

The photographer Julius Shulman, who was based on the West Coast, created several images of the Miller House. 13 Writing about a group of six of them that appeared in the May 1937 issue of Architectural Record, Stephen Leet has explained that:
Neutra, Shulman and Miller cleverly rearranged the few furnishings she [Miller] had - a glass-topped coffee table, two Navajo saddle blankets, a rattan chair, a potted manzanita tree, flower vases and metal bowls, a few magazines and books and a Neutra-designed floor lamp - recomposing each room with essentially the same pieces to create six interior views. 14

驻扎在西海岸的摄影师Julius Shulman创作了几张米勒之家的图片。13 斯蒂芬-利特在写到一组出现在1937年5月的《建筑记录》上的六张照片时解释说。
诺伊特拉、舒尔曼和米勒巧妙地重新安排了她[米勒]拥有的少数家具--一张玻璃顶的咖啡桌、两条纳瓦霍马鞍毯、一把藤椅、一盆曼珠沙华树、花瓶和金属碗、一些杂志和书籍以及诺伊特拉设计的落地灯--用基本相同的物品重新组合每个房间，创造出六个室内景观。14

Four sets of Shulman photographs of the Miller house were produced between 1937 and 1941. Vases of flowers are often visible, undoubtedly placed there for photographic reasons, to soften the hard lines of the architecture, to create focal points and to help articulate spatial relationships.

1937年至1941年间，舒尔曼拍摄了四套米勒家的照片。花瓶经常可以看到，无疑是出于摄影的原因放在那里，以软化建筑的硬线条，创造焦点，并帮助阐明空间关系。

Writing about Neutra's 1946 Desert House, created for Edgar J. Kaufmann in Palm Springs, the architectural historian Alice T. Friedman has pointed out that the architect exercised strict control over how the interior was photographed. 'Neutra', she wrote:
laid out his instructions for photographing the interior of the Kaufmann house. He explained that, 'the particular house for which Mr Kaufmann, as myself, has made great personal effort and which has subtle aesthetic qualities can be taken like for a high-class photo-magazine rather than for a furniture review. Thus, when in doubt, eliminate the furniture, or even the picture from its place; we may have in mind to reconsider the position:15

建筑历史学家Alice T. Friedman在写到诺伊特拉1946年在棕榈泉为Edgar J. Kaufmann设计的沙漠之家时指出，建筑师对室内的拍摄方式进行了严格控制。她写道，"诺伊特拉"。
她写道："纽特拉为拍摄考夫曼房子的内部布置了他的指示。他解释说，"考夫曼先生，就像我自己一样，为其付出了巨大的个人努力，并且具有微妙的美学特质，可以像为高级摄影杂志而不是为家具评论而拍摄的房子。因此，在有疑问的时候，把家具，甚至图片从它的位置上移开；我们可能会考虑重新考虑这个位置：15

In the Miller House vases of flowers were positioned, for example, on some low shelving and on a round coffee table in the living room, as well as on the floor in the studio. In the widely reproduced image of Grace Miller sitting in the glazed porch leading from the living room, reading a book, with a view of the desert and the mountains in the distance, a metal bowl placed on the floor and containing flowers (which, from the archive images, look like tree blossoms and carnations) creates a boundary where the porch joins the pool, thereby emphasising the continuity between inside and outside (fig. 66). It also acts as a counterpoint for the tamed potted plants at the other side of the pool, and for the wild desert plants beyond them, making a subtle commentary on the transition from tamed to wild nature, a strategy which, inspired by Mies van der Rohe and others, had, by that time, become a familiar modernist trope. It is notable that the bowl is situated at the very point at which the sunlight turned to shadow on the floor when Shulman was taking his photograph. Forty years later, Shulman explained that 'the true landscape photograph is one in which not only the plant material is depicted, but the setting', adding that 'it is important to constantly relate the garden to the house. He also maintained that he was interested in shots in which 'the sun uniformly illuminates the interior-exterior spatial volumes that show the blend of architecture, interiors, and landscape in a purposeful way: 1 Those ideas were clearly already informing his approach to taking photographs of houses in the 19305.

在米勒家，花瓶被放置在例如一些低矮的架子上和客厅的圆茶几上，以及工作室的地板上。在被广泛转载的格蕾丝-米勒坐在从客厅出来的玻璃门廊里看书的图片中，可以看到远处的沙漠和山脉，一个放置在地板上的金属碗里装着鲜花（从档案图片来看，这些鲜花看起来像树花和康乃馨），在门廊与水池的交界处创造了一个边界，从而强调了内部和外部的连续性（图66）。它还与水池另一侧的驯服盆栽以及它们之外的野生沙漠植物形成对立，对从驯服到野生的自然过渡做出了微妙的评论，这种策略在密斯-凡德罗等人的启发下，在当时已经成为一种熟悉的现代主义模式。值得注意的是，当舒尔曼拍摄照片时，这只碗正好位于阳光在地板上转为阴影的位置。40年后，舒尔曼解释说，"真正的风景照不仅要描绘植物材料，还要描绘环境"，并补充说，"不断将花园与房子联系起来是很重要的。他还坚持认为，他对那些 "阳光均匀地照亮室内外空间体量的照片感兴趣，这些照片以一种有目的的方式展示了建筑、室内和景观的融合：1 这些想法显然已经影响了他在19305年拍摄房屋的方法。

Living among plants has a humanizing effect and helps to restore to a healthy condition minds that are burdened with grief, pain and trouble.' George H. Manaker

在植物中生活有一种人性化的效果，有助于恢复被悲伤、痛苦和麻烦所困扰的心灵。健康的心态，而这些心态是由悲伤、痛苦和麻烦所造成的。乔治-H-马纳克

While in 1950s California, a new model of domestic modernism offered people an indoor/outdoor modern lifestyle in which the natural world played a key role, the urban areas of the United States were being transformed by an expansion of office work, the commercial ambitions of large corporations, and a growth in consumption and public leisure.? To meet the needs of the new spaces in which those activities took place, and because large sums of money were being spent on them, the American interior design press advocated a shift in designers' activities from residential to non-residential work. As Harvey Anderson explained in the April 1955 issue of Interior Design magazine, 'It is the interior designer with experience in residential work who is doing the best job in the contract field', adding that 'he has taken the commercial stigma out of non-residential interiors by giving to them a distinctly residential character!3 **Nature inside played an important role in that transfer of 'residential character', or domesticity, into the public sphere. As a means of making people feel at home and comfortable, greenery began to appear in numerous offices, hotels, restaurants, banks, shops and shopping malls. Given that their meanings were rooted in the anti-commercialism of the domestic interior, plants were able to perform that task very effectively.**

在20世纪50年代的加利福尼亚，一种新的家庭现代主义模式为人们提供了一种室内/室外的现代生活方式，其中自然界发挥了关键作用，而美国的城市地区正被办公室工作的扩大、大公司的商业野心以及消费和公共休闲的增长所改变。为了满足进行这些活动的新空间的需要，并且因为大量的资金被花在这些活动上，美国的室内设计媒体提倡设计师的活动从住宅转向非住宅工作。正如哈维-安德森在1955年4月的《室内设计》杂志上所解释的那样，"具有住宅工作经验的室内设计师在合同领域做得最好"，并补充说 "他通过赋予非住宅的室内环境以明显的住宅特征，消除了商业上的污名！3 **自然在将 "住宅特征 "或家庭性转移到公共领域的过程中发挥了重要作用。作为一种让人们感到宾至如归和舒适的手段，绿色植物开始出现在许多办公室、酒店、餐馆、银行、商店和购物中心。鉴于它们的意义植根于家庭内部的反商业主义，植物能够非常有效地完成这一任务。**

As was demonstrated in Chapter 3, in the second half of the nineteenth century winter gardens, people's palaces, department stores, grand hotels and department stores had been transformed by the addition of exotic plants that generated an ambiance of leisure and luxury. The United States post-1945 inside spaces of consumption and leisure had their roots in that earlier era and, like their antecedents, they offered antidotes to the numerous ills that accompanied urban life. Not until the 1940s, however, did a group of specialist design professionals emerge to make all this possible. While in earlier decades indoor planting had been undertaken by architects working directly with commercial nurseries, by the 1940s architects were frequently working with interior decorators and designers, landscape architects, interior landscapers (increasingly also referred to as interiorscapers and plantscapers) and horticulturists to create plant-filled interiors.

正如第三章所展示的那样，在十九世纪下半叶，冬季花园、人民的宫殿、百货商店、大饭店和百货公司都因添加了异国植物而发生了变化，产生了休闲和奢侈的氛围。美国1945年后的消费和休闲空间起源于那个更早的时代，就像它们的前身一样，它们为伴随城市生活的众多弊病提供了解药。然而，直到20世纪40年代，才出现了一批专业设计人员，使这一切成为可能。在早期的几十年里，室内种植是由建筑师直接与商业苗圃合作进行的，而到了20世纪40年代，建筑师经常与室内装饰师和设计师、景观建筑师、室内景观设计师（越来越多地被称为室内设计师和植物设计师）和园艺师合作，创造充满植物的室内空间。

The mid-century desire in the United States to (re)turn to the natural world was noted in 1964 by Leo Marx. 'An inchoate longing for a more "natural" environment enters into the contemptuous attitude that many Americans adopt towards urban life', he wrote.+ In support of that 'longing', exotic plants and flowers, and often trees, were brought into a range of new urban commercial buildings that supported dining, shopping and other leisure and commercial activities. The idea of Paradise on earth also resurfaced in that new context.

利奥-马克思（Leo Marx）在1964年指出，美国在本世纪中期渴望（重新）转向自然世界。他写道："许多美国人对城市生活采取的轻蔑态度中包含着对更多 "自然 "环境的渴望"。人间天堂的概念也在这种新的背景下重新出现。

The new commercial and corporate spaces were mostly privatelv financed and their owners could, more or less, select those who entered them. Consumers were invited into a world of affluence and luxury in which they were made to feel at home. In addition, many of these commercial buildings sought to deny their urban-ness by turning inwards, ignoring the environments outside and creating cocooned inside spaces. The introduction of nature into many late-modern indoor urban environments, which would otherwise have been exclusively defined by their commercial agendas, was intended to provide a sense of harmony and identity. It also brought texture and colour to compensate for the buildings' spare forms, industrial materials and, often, superhuman scale. Bringing nature inside also introduced a sense of the changing seasons into those unnatural, man-made, static structures.

新的商业和公司空间大多由私人出资，它们的所有者或多或少可以选择进入它们的人。消费者被邀请进入一个富裕和豪华的世界，他们在其中有宾至如归的感觉。此外，**许多这样的商业建筑试图通过向内转来否认它们的城市性质，忽略外面的环境，创造出茧状的内部空间。在许多晚期现代城市室内环境中引入自然，是为了提供一种和谐和认同感，否则这些环境将完全由其商业议程所界定。它还带来了质感和色彩，以弥补建筑的多余形式、工业材料和通常的超人类规模。将自然带入室内也为那些非自然的、人造的、静态的结构引入了一种季节变化的感觉。**

This chapter explores three examples of American plant-filled interiors in late-modern commercial and corporate architectural structures: New York's Four Seasons Restaurant of 1959; Dallas's NorthPark Center of 1965; and New York's Ford Foundation Building, an office complex completed in 1968. All three had plants and flowers introduced into them, interventions which required their architects and interior designers to collaborate with a range of other professionals. The Four Seasons Restaurant in New York, which was designed from the outset to contain trees and a range of plants, was the result of input from two architects, an interior designer/decorator, a landscape architect and an interior landscaper/horticulturist. The restaurant group that financed the project also influenced the design decisions, including the introduction of plants.6

本章探讨了美国晚期商业和企业建筑结构中充满植物的室内装饰的三个例子。1959年的纽约四季餐厅；1965年的达拉斯NorthPark中心；以及1968年建成的纽约福特基金会大楼，一个办公综合体。所有这三个项目都有植物和花卉被引入其中，这些干预措施要求其建筑师和室内设计师与一系列其他专业人士合作。纽约的四季餐厅，从一开始就被设计成包含树木和各种植物，是两位建筑师、一位室内设计师/装饰师、一位景观设计师和一位室内景观设计师/园艺师共同参与的结果。资助该项目的餐厅集团也影响了设计决策，包括植物的引进。

When Ludwig Mies van der Rohe completed the Seagram Building on Park Avenue and 52nd Street in 1958, it was clear that something was needed to fill a space in the ground-floor lobby area and to attract visitors to the building. Conversations took place between Phyllis Lambert, the daughter of the CEO and Head of Planning at Seagram, and Mies as to what that should be (fig. 76). A museum, an antiques shop, a bank showroom and a car showroom were all discussed but, in the end, Jerry Brody, an executive of a company called Restaurant Associates that was running the project, suggested a restaurant, specifically one that would appeal to a modern, discriminating and distinctive clientele. Philip Johnson, the director of the Department of Architecture at New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) at the time, was tasked with designing it, or at least with coordinating its design.?

当路德维希-密斯-凡德罗于1958年完成位于公园大道和第52街的西格拉姆大厦时，很明显需要一些东西来填补底层大厅的空间，并吸引游客到该大厦。西格拉姆公司首席执行官兼规划主管的女儿菲利斯-兰伯特（Phyllis Lambert）和密斯之间进行了对话，讨论了这应该是什么（图76）。博物馆、古董店、银行展厅和汽车展厅都被讨论过，但最后，负责该项目的一家名为Restaurant Associates的公司的高管杰里-布罗迪（Jerry Brody）建议开一家餐厅，特别是一家能够吸引现代、有鉴赏力和与众不同的顾客的餐厅。当时纽约现代艺术博物馆（MoMA）的建筑部主任菲利普-约翰逊（Philip Johnson）负责设计，或者至少负责协调设计工作。

In July 1959 the restaurant opened to the public. It contained a Grill Room and a Pool Room, the latter earning its name from the 20-foot-square Carrera marble pool positioned at its centre. As the Pool Room was a large space, it needed something other than tables and chairs to fill it. A decision was made to add four trees at the corners of the pool, as well as some potted plants suspended from a horizontal rail that spanned the floor-to- ceiling windows down one side of the room (fig. 77). The trees were planted in large round pots with flowers growing below them. As the room had 20-foot ceilings, trees 17 feet tall were used to make the necessary visual impact and to fit with the scale. Originally, four fig trees were introduced. Later azaleas and birch trees were used in the spring; philodendrons and queen palm trees in the summer; burnt-orange and yellow chrysanthemums and oak-leaf branches in the autumn; and white chrysanthemums and white birch trees in the winter. The planting scheme changed over the life of the restaurant and, at one point, blossoming cherry trees made an appearance.

1959年7月，该餐厅向公众开放。它包括一个烧烤室和一个台球室，后者的名字来自于位于中心的20英尺见方的卡雷拉大理石泳池。由于台球室是一个很大的空间，除了桌子和椅子之外，它还需要其他东西来填充。我们决定在水池的四角增加四棵树，并在房间一侧的落地窗上悬挂一些盆栽（图77）。这些树被种在大圆盆里，下面种着花。由于房间的天花板有20英尺高，所以使用了17英尺高的树，以产生必要的视觉冲击，并与规模相适应。最初，引进了四棵无花果树。后来，春天使用了杜鹃花和白桦树；夏天使用了杜鹃花和皇后棕榈树；秋天使用了焦橙色和黄色的菊花和橡树叶枝；冬天使用了白色的菊花和白桦树。种植方案在餐厅的生命周期中不断变化，一度出现了开花的樱花树。

Before Restaurant Associates, which was co-run by Jerry Brody and Joe Baum, made their pitch for the Four Seasons, they had worked on a number of other smart, themed restaurants, including the Hawaiian Room in the Hotel Lexington, which was appropriately decorated with palm trees and exotic plants. The Forum of the Twelve Caesars in the Rockefeller Center, on which they had worked with the interior decorator William Pahlmann, was another of their restaurant projects.& In 2009 Phyllis Lambert recalled that, 'Philip and I went with Jerry Brody out to New Jersey and had a meal at his restaurant, where they gave us soup in profiterole bowls. Then we went to the completely over-the-top Forum of the Twelve Caesars, designed by Bill Pahlmann' (fig. 78).

在杰里-布罗迪和乔-鲍姆共同经营的 "餐厅联营公司 "为四季酒店做宣传之前，他们曾为其他一些聪明的主题餐厅工作过，包括列克星敦酒店的夏威夷厅，那里用棕榈树和异国植物装饰得很合适。2009年，菲利斯-兰伯特回忆说："菲利普和我与杰里-布罗迪一起去了新泽西，在他的餐厅吃了一顿饭，他们给我们用profiterole碗喝汤。然后我们去了比尔-帕尔曼设计的完全夸张的十二凯撒论坛'（图78）。

Brody and Baum had established the typology for luxurious, highly decorated, themed restaurants, the aesthetics of which were a far cry from the restrained, minimalist, yet also highly luxurious, approach advocated by Johnson for Mies's Seagram Building. But it appears that Brody and Baum had significant influence over the designs of the restaurants they worked on, and the Four Seasons was no exception. They undoubtedly suggested that Pahlmann, whom the had used on several of their projects, be brought in to help with the restaurant's interior design. As John Mariani and Alex von Binder later explained, Lambert and Johnson "were convinced the arrangement [with Pahlmann] was not going to go smoothly as they felt that they were diametrically opposed in their attitudes!9 It seems that Johnson and Pahlmann did dislike each other but, at a later date, Johnson was to claim that 'Pahlmann was very very helpful with the interior, especially with the table placement and kitchen layout o The pool and the use of chairs based on Mies's Brno design in the restaurant were apparently Pahlmann's ideas.

布罗迪和鲍姆建立了豪华的、高度装饰的、有主题的餐厅类型，其美学与约翰逊为密斯的西格拉姆大厦所倡导的克制的、极简的、但也是高度豪华的方法相差甚远。但是，布罗迪和鲍姆似乎对他们所参与的餐厅设计有很大影响，四季酒店也不例外。毫无疑问，他们建议将他们曾在多个项目中使用过的帕尔曼请来帮助进行餐厅的室内设计。正如John Mariani和Alex von Binder后来解释的那样，Lambert和Johnson "确信[与Pahlmann]的安排不会顺利，因为他们觉得他们的态度截然相反！9看来Johnson和Pahlmann确实不喜欢对方，但在后来，Johnson声称'Pahlmann对室内装修非常有帮助，特别是在桌子的摆放和厨房的布局上。

Pahlmann had made his reputation in the inter-war years and the 19405 as a decorator of expensive homes, and his interiors were highly eclectic, combining traditional and modern stvles. His move to the contract field restaurants included - was in line with the comments made in the April 1955 issue of Interior Design. His contributions, however minor, undoubtedly helped to bring a level of domestic comfort and luxury into the Four Seasons.

帕尔曼在战时和19405年作为昂贵住宅的装饰者而声名鹊起，他的室内装饰是高度折衷的，结合了传统和现代风格。他转向合同领域的餐馆--与1955年4月的《室内设计》杂志上的评论相一致。他的贡献，无论多么微小，无疑都有助于将国内的舒适和豪华程度带入四季酒店。

The realisation of an interior scheme that involved nature required yet another kind of expertise, however. Although it was an interior project, the scheme for the Four Seasons required the knowledge base of someone who was used to working with plants and landscapes. The landscape architect Karl Linn (who, in later life, was a key advocate of using shared gardens to create communities) was employed to meet that need." Arguably, this is an early example of what later, first in the office context and subsequently more widely, became known as an 'interior landscape', a point that was recognised by Mariani and von Binder when they wrote: 'Here was a restaurant whose interior was actually landscaped, not just set with flowers and potted plants.!'12

然而，实现一个涉及自然的室内方案需要另一种专业知识。尽管这是一个室内项目，但四季酒店的方案需要一个习惯于与植物和景观打交道的人的知识基础。景观设计师卡尔-林恩（他在晚年是利用共享花园创建社区的主要倡导者）被雇用来满足这一需求"。可以说，这是一个早期的例子，后来，首先在办公室背景下，随后在更广泛的范围内，被称为 "室内景观"，这一点被Mariani和von Binder认可，他们写道："这是一家餐厅，其内部实际上是景观，而不仅仅是设置了鲜花和盆栽。

Linn, who had already designed the exterior green spaces of the Seagram Building, was commissioned to create an interior design with plantings keyed to the theme of the four seasons. He rejected the idea of Picasso sculptures round the pool, and Restaurant Associates decided that trees should be used instead to serve as a kind of sheltering canopy. The project required Linn to undertake a great deal of research, and he visited many nurseries to find matching trees, which had to be pruned before shipment. With the plant psychologist O. Wesley Davidson and the lighting expert Richard Kelly, Lin developed a system that provided consistent humidity, as well as lighting and temperature controls that would allow for appropriate maintenance.

林恩已经设计了西格拉姆大厦的外部绿色空间。林恩已经设计了西格拉姆大厦的外部绿地，他被委托创造一个以四季为主题的室内设计。以四季为主题的植物。他拒绝了毕加索的想法 雕塑的想法，餐厅协会决定用树木来代替。他拒绝了在游泳池周围设置毕加索雕塑的想法，餐厅协会决定用树木来代替，作为一种遮蔽的天幕。这个项目 该项目要求林恩进行大量的研究，他走访了许多苗圃，以寻找匹配的树木。他走访了许多苗圃以寻找匹配的树木，这些树木在装运前必须进行修剪。运走。在植物心理学家O.Wesley Davidson和照明专家Richard Kelly的帮助下，林恩开发了一个系统。专家理查德-凯利(Richard Kelly)一起开发了一个系统，提供稳定的 湿度，以及照明和温度控制，以便能够进行适当的维护。适当的维护。

Inspired by the fact that the trees were to be replaced four times a year, the idea of seasonality became the restaurant's theme (and name). Baum admired two existing Four Seasons hotels in Munich and Hamburg and, following a suggestion from the editor of House Beautiful, Elizabeth Gordon, decided that 'everything from plants to ashtrays would be chosen and designed to fit the idea of passing seasons'! 13 Even the staff uniforms and the upholstery changed four times a year. The strategy also fitted with the idea of the food being contemporary and in tune with the seasons. In the form of seasonally rotated trees and plants, and, more subtly, as part of a commitment to the very idea of renewal, nature was introduced to create a sense of change in an otherwise static late-modern environment. It softened the pervasive monumental aesthetic and added a human dimension. Just as Johnson and Pahlmann needed to engage Linn as a consultant, so the landscape architect was, in turn, dependent on the expertise of Everett Lawson Conklin, the horticulturist and interior landscape expert employed to work on the project. It was he who advised on the trees and plants, supplied them from his nursery, and helped maintain them.

**受一年更换四次树木这一事实的启发，季节性的概念成为餐厅的主题（和名称）。鲍姆欣赏了慕尼黑和汉堡的两家现有的四季酒店，并根据《美丽屋》编辑伊丽莎白-戈登的建议，决定 "从植物到烟灰缸的一切都将被选择和设计为符合季节变化的理念"！13 甚至连员工的制服和室内装饰品都要更换四次。13 甚至连员工的制服和室内装饰品也一年换四次。这一策略也符合食物是现代的和与季节相适应的想法。以季节性轮换的树木和植物的形式，更微妙的是，作为对更新理念的承诺的一部分，自然被引入到一个本来静态的晚期现代环境中，以创造一种变化感。它软化了普遍存在的纪念碑式的美学，并增加了一个人类的维度。**正如约翰逊和帕尔曼需要聘请林恩作为顾问一样，景观设计师反过来也依赖埃弗雷特-劳森-康克林的专业知识，他是受雇为项目工作的园艺师和室内景观专家。正是他对树木和植物提出了建议，从他的苗圃中提供这些植物，并帮助维护它们。

The interior landscape industry developed in earnest in the late 19405, though there was still only a small body of practitioners - Conklin among them. Describing himself early on as an 'interior planting specialist, his experience as a sales manager and division manager for the Bobbink& Atkins nursery in East Rutherford, between 1938 and 1957, had prepared him for his future career in horticulture. From 1957 until his retirement in 1982, Conklin was the president and chairman of Everett Conklin & Company International of Montvale, New Jersey. In addition to his input into New York's Four Seasons Restaurant, he later worked on the Philharmonic Cafe at the Lincoln Center, the Promenade Cafe in the Rockefeller Center and the indoor garden in the Ford Foundation Building. He also created the dramatic plantscaping in the Crown Center Hotel in Kansas, and was the chairman of the floral decorations committee for President Richard M. Nixon's inaugural balls in 1969 and 1973.14 One of Conklin's key contributions to indoor horticulture was his discovery of the need to acclimatise plants to low light levels before installation. By the early 1970s his nursery business had become one of the largest interiorscaping companies in the United States, specialising in shopping malls and hotels.

室内景观行业在19405年末得到了认真的发展，尽管当时还只有一小部分从业者--康克林就是其中之一。他很早就将自己描述为 "室内种植专家"，在1938年至1957年期间，他在东卢瑟福的Bobbink&Atkins苗圃担任销售经理和部门经理的经历，为他未来的园艺事业做好了准备。从1957年到1982年退休，康克林是新泽西州蒙特维尔的埃弗雷特-康克林国际公司的总裁和主席。除了对纽约四季餐厅的投入，他后来还参与了林肯中心的爱乐咖啡厅、洛克菲勒中心的长廊咖啡厅和福特基金会大楼的室内花园。他还创造了堪萨斯州皇冠中心酒店的戏剧性植物景观，并在1969年和1973年担任理查德-M-尼克松总统就职舞会的花艺装饰委员会主席。到20世纪70年代初，他的苗圃业务已成为美国最大的室内园艺公司之一，专门从事购物中心和酒店的业务。

As it had been in the nineteenth-century domestic parlour, and in the Villa Tugendhat, nature in the Four Seasons was introduced as a form of art, albeit now as a form of modern art that helped create a space of contemporary affluence and taste. Plants and flowers sat comfortably alongside the Richard Lippold sculpture located above the bar in the Grill Room, the metal chain drapes designed by Marie Nichols, and the artworks by Picasso, Miró and others. The works of art in the restaurant had been approved by MoMA's fine-art curator, Alfred H. Barr. The furniture and designed objects in the restaurant - among them the banquettes designed by Johnson, the Eames private-party chairs, Eero Saarinen' hassocks and tabouret tables, and various items designed by Garth and Ada Louise Huxtable (including a set of service-ware comprising in excess of one hundred pieces) - were also, by association, raised to the level of art. Art, design and nature combined, therefore, to present an elite, sumptuous, commercial interior environment.

正如在十九世纪的家庭客厅和图根哈特别墅中一样，四季酒店的自然被作为一种艺术形式引入，尽管现在是一种现代艺术形式，有助于创造一个当代富裕和品味的空间。植物和鲜花与位于烧烤室酒吧上方的理查德-李波德（Richard Lippold）雕塑、玛丽-尼古拉斯（Marie Nichols）设计的金属链窗帘以及毕加索、米罗等人的艺术作品一起舒适地坐在一起。餐厅里的艺术品是由MoMA的美术策展人Alfred H. Barr批准的。餐厅里的家具和设计品--其中包括约翰逊设计的宴会桌、埃姆斯的私人派对椅、埃罗-沙里宁的长袜和塔布瑞特桌，以及加思和艾达-路易斯-哈克斯塔布设计的各种物品（包括一套超过100件的服务器皿）--也被联想到了艺术层面。因此，艺术、设计和自然相结合，呈现出一个精英的、奢华的、商业的室内环境。

The Four Seasons was an exceptional restaurant that brought late-modern commercial architecture, modern design, art and nature together in its interior for a select audience. Dallas's shopping mall, known as the NorthPark Center, which opened in 1965, employed similar strategies but aimed them at a larger section of the public. While the restaurant was promoting a new modern eating experience, the Dallas mall set out to create a new modern retail experience that combined shopping with leisure, pleasure and social activity. 

四季餐厅是一家特殊的餐厅，它将晚期的商业建筑、现代设计、艺术和自然结合在一起，为特定的观众提供了一个内部空间。达拉斯的购物中心，即1965年开业的NorthPark中心，也采用了类似的策略，但目标是更多的公众。当餐厅在推广一种新的现代饮食体验时，达拉斯的购物中心则着手创造一种新的现代零售体验，将购物与休闲、娱乐和社会活动相结合。

The task of designing NorthPark's flagship retail outlet, the Nieman Marcus store, was originally granted to Eero Saarinen. When Saarinen died in 1961, however, the work was taken over by Kevin Roche, who was working in Saarinen's office at the time and had been collaborating with him on the design. Roche had begun his studies under Mies at the Illinois

设计NorthPark的旗舰零售店Nieman Marcus店的任务最初是授予Eero Saarinen的。然而，当萨里宁于1961年去世后，这项工作由凯文-罗奇接手，他当时在萨里宁的办公室工作，并一直与他合作设计。罗氏曾在伊利诺伊州的米斯手下开始学习。

Institute of Technology in the late 1940s, but did not remain there long because he found the teaching lacked social engagement. He subsequently took a position in Saarinen's office in 1950.15 The generational shift from Mies to Saarinen brought a transformation of interwar modernism into a softer version that was infused with Scandinavian humanism. Roche felt more comfortable in the Saarinen office than he had under the tutelage of Mies. **His contribution to the Dallas mall represented, therefore, a new phase of late-modern architecture that was comfortable with embracing nature in order to soften its hard materials and humanise its forms.**

20世纪40年代末，他在技术学院工作，但由于发现教学缺乏社会参与，他没有在那里呆很久。他随后于1950年在萨里宁的办公室任职。15 从密斯到萨里宁的代际转换带来了战时现代主义的转变，使其成为一个柔和的版本，并注入了斯堪的纳维亚的人文精神。在萨里宁的办公室里，罗氏比在密斯的指导下感到更加舒适。**因此，他对达拉斯商场的贡献代表了晚期现代建筑的一个新阶段，即舒适地拥抱自然，以软化其硬材料并使其形式人性化。**

Urban and suburban malls led the way by facing inwards, and bringing the outside indoors. 16 The first enclosed mall - Southdale, located in a suburb of Minneapolis - had been developed in 1956 by a Viennese modernist émigré, Victor Gruen. 17 The aim had been to protect shoppers from harsh weather and to separate them from the crime and troubles of the world outside. Gruen's vision had been the creation of a modern agora, a heart of the community. Nature, in the form of potted plants and fountains, was included as a reminder of the more pleasant aspects of the world outside that had been left behind. The introduction of natural elements also helped soften the hard structure of the malls, created a homely atmosphere, added beauty (often reinforced by the addition of pieces of sculpture and works of art) and compensated for the otherwise overtly commercial function of the spaces in question. Southdale's malf hoasted an aviary full of songbirds and a fishpond, as well as a great deal of foliage. A skylight was included to allow sunshine to penetrate, reassuring visitors of the continued existence of an outside world. Although malls were public spaces, the surveillance systems that were installed in them Facilitated a high level of control and ensured that unwanted visitors could not enter.

**城市和郊区的购物中心引领了这一潮流，它们面向内部，将外部环境引入室内。**第一个封闭式商场--位于明尼阿波利斯郊区的Southdale--是由维也纳现代主义移民Victor Gruen在1956年开发的。其目的是为了保护购物者免受恶劣天气的影响，并将他们与外面世界的犯罪和麻烦分开。格鲁恩的愿景是创造一个现代的广场，一个社区的心脏。以盆栽和喷泉为形式的自然元素被纳入其中，以提醒人们外面的世界被遗弃的更愉快的一面。自然元素的引入也有助于软化商场的坚硬结构，创造一种家庭氛围，增加美感（通常通过增加雕塑作品和艺术品来加强），弥补有关空间的其他明显的商业功能。索斯代尔的半山腰有一个养满鸣禽的鸟笼和一个鱼池，以及大量的树叶。一个天窗被包括在内，让阳光穿透，让游客确信外面的世界继续存在。尽管商场是公共空间，但安装在其中的监控系统促进了高水平的控制，并确保不受欢迎的游客无法进入。

The Dallas mall was the brainchild of the art collectors and property developers Ray and Patsy Nasher, and is located on the northwest corner of Northwest Highway and Central Expressway. 18 Built on a site of 97 acres, it was completed in August 1965 and contained eighty new retail stores. It was the largest climate-controlled retail centre in the world in its day and it went on to win the Association of Interior Architects' Design of the Decade award. As with the Four Seasons, creating the Dallas mall required input from a group of experts. The architects, Harwood K. Smith and E. G. Hamilton, were a local team.19 They worked alongside Kevin Roche, the planner Marvin Springer, and the landscape architect Lawrence Halprin.z In late 1962 the whole team was convened by Ray Nasher for a five-day brainstorming session. The scheme that emerged was an L-shaped configuration with an anchor store at the corner and each end. Varied sequences of interior promenades and courts connected them. It was Hamilton's decision to call NorthPark a 'center' rather than a 'mall' to give it a different identity, and he wanted the interior to be conceived as a series of spaces, as in an art gallery, rather than a corridor. The design was strongly unified, and included abundant natural light. Individual stores were subjected to rigorous design review to ensure that cohesion was maintained. Hamilton, who was a great admirer of Mies, was keen that the centre be perceived as 'architecture' rather than a 'stage set' He came up with a simple palette to draw everything together, which consisted of cream glazed bricks, cast stone and concrete. The result was a soft, contemporary building that was neither monumental nor severe.

达拉斯商场是艺术收藏家和房地产开发商雷和帕西-纳舍的创意，位于西北公路和中央高速公路的西北角。18它建在一个97英亩的场地上，于1965年8月竣工，包含80家新的零售店。它是当时世界上最大的气候控制的零售中心，它后来赢得了室内建筑师协会的十年设计奖。与四季酒店一样，创建达拉斯购物中心需要一组专家的意见。建筑师Harwood K. Smith和E. G. Hamilton是一个本地团队。19 他们与Kevin Roche、规划师Marvin Springer和景观建筑师Lawrence Halprin一起工作。出现的方案是一个L形的配置，在角落和两端各有一个主力店。不同序列的内部长廊和庭院将它们连接起来。汉密尔顿决定将NorthPark称为 "中心 "而不是 "商场"，以赋予它不同的身份，他希望内部被设想为一系列的空间，就像一个艺术画廊，而不是一个走廊。该设计具有强烈的统一性，并包括丰富的自然光线。各个商店都经过了严格的设计审查，以确保保持凝聚力。汉密尔顿是密斯的忠实崇拜者，他非常希望该中心被视为 "建筑 "而不是 "舞台"。其结果是一个柔和的、现代的建筑，既没有纪念性，也不严厉。

Just as Linn had been involved with the Four Seasons, so a landscape architect was needed to assist with the interior at NorthPark. Lawrence Halprin had opened his San Francisco practice in 1949. He had a particular interest in enlivening cities through the addition of landscapes. Together with the local landscaper Richard B. Myrick, he undertook the design of the interior courtyards, the landscaping and the planters at NorthPark. Patsy Nasher was also interested in the landscaping and planting, and worked closely beside Halprin. Halprin was especially fond of using water, and in Dallas he worked on the pond project outside Nieman Marcus and created two more fountains outside the Titche Goettinger and J. C. Penney stores (fig. 79). The first comprises a Zen-like fountain, a footbridge and four large planters made of dark glazed bricks on which children love to slide. The fountain outside Titche Goettinger is octagonal and features a water. and -light show, while the last is rectangular and boasts round terracotta planters filled with chrysanthemums around its edge. The fountains provide an animated counterpoint to the relative calm of the retail concourses. Halprin's work also played an important part in the creation of social spaces at NorthPark in which people could congregate.

正如林恩参与了四季酒店的建设一样，NorthPark的内部建设也需要一位景观设计师来协助。Lawrence Halprin于1949年在旧金山开设了他的事务所。他对通过增加景观来活跃城市特别感兴趣。他与当地的景观设计师Richard B. Myrick一起，承担了NorthPark的内部庭院、景观和花槽的设计工作。Patsy Nasher也对景观设计和种植感兴趣，并在Halprin身边密切合作。哈尔普林特别喜欢用水，在达拉斯，他参与了尼曼-马库斯外面的池塘项目，又在蒂切-戈丁格和J.C.彭尼商店外面创造了两个喷泉（图79）。第一个包括一个禅宗式的喷泉，一个人行桥和四个由深色釉面砖制成的大花盆，孩子们喜欢在上面滑动。Titche Goettinger外面的喷泉是八角形的，有水和灯光表演，而最后一个是长方形的，边缘有圆形的陶土花盆，上面种满了菊花。喷泉为零售大厅的相对平静提供了一个生动的对立面。Halprin的作品在NorthPark创造社会空间方面也发挥了重要作用，人们可以在那里聚集。

From the outset the large central area of the mall was filled with numerous potted plants. Anthuriums, bromeliads, grasses and mother-in- law's tongues were among the many varieties that were included. They were arranged in a highly stylised, modern manner and sat alongside contemporary art from the Nashers' collection, which included pieces by Barry Flanagan, Antony Gormley, Henry Moore, James Rosenquist, Joel Shapiro, Frank Stella and Andy Warhol, among others (fig. 80). The use of polished concrete on the mall floor added to the dramatic visual effect of the plants, which were embedded in a variety of circular, square and rectangular planters, arranged in regular groupings.2 Most of the planters were wide and low so that the flowers and plants they contained showed to good effect from a higher level in the mall (fig. 81). Much attention was given to the geometry of the clusters of potted plants, which provided large blocks of colour and texture. There was a strong artistic and architectural flavour to the arrangements. In addition to those positioned in the centre of the pedestrianised areas, plants were also used throughout the mall to function as space dividers, barriers and screens. As at the Four Seasons, they were changed four times annually according to the time of year.

从一开始，商场的大型中央区域就摆满了许多盆栽。红掌、凤梨、草和婆婆丁是其中的许多品种。它们以高度风格化的现代方式排列，与纳什夫妇收藏的当代艺术放在一起，其中包括巴里-弗拉纳根、安东尼-戈姆利、亨利-摩尔、詹姆斯-罗森奎斯特、乔尔-夏皮罗、弗兰克-斯特拉和安迪-沃霍尔等人的作品（图80）。商场地面上使用的抛光混凝土增加了植物的戏剧性视觉效果，这些植物被嵌入各种圆形、方形和长方形的花盆中，有规律地排列。大部分的花盆都很宽很低，这样从商场的高处看去，花盆里的花草就会有很好的效果（图81）。花盆群的几何形状受到了很大的关注，它提供了大量的颜色和纹理。这些安排具有强烈的艺术和建筑风味。除了放置在步行区中心的植物外，整个商场还使用了植物作为空间分隔物、屏障和屏风。与四季酒店一样，这些植物根据一年中的不同时期每年更换四次。

The Ford Foundation Building at 320 East 43rd Street in New York, one of the most polluted areas of Manhattan, opened in 1968 featuring an indoor garden in an enclosed atrium. Although the building was a site of office work rather than of consumption or leisure, it also sought to draw employees during non-working hours, and members of the public. It adopted the idea, inspired by the shopping mall, of turning itself away from the street and of creating its own outside world within a newly built structure. In the words of David Gissen, it built on the nineteenth-century idea of using 'indoor greenery as a counter to urban industrialization in Western metropolises ... offering a parallel indoor world ... that contrasted with the environmental depravity of the industrializing city'22 However, as Gissen also points out, the inclusion of inside greenery additionally increased the value of the space in question.23

位于纽约东43街320号的福特基金会大楼，是曼哈顿污染最严重的地区之一，于1968年开业，在一个封闭的中庭中设有一个室内花园。虽然该大楼是一个办公场所，而不是消费或休闲场所，但它也试图在非工作时间吸引员工和公众成员。它采用了受购物中心启发的想法，将自己从街道上移开，并在一个新建的结构中创造自己的外部世界。用David Gissen的话说，它建立在19世纪的理念之上，即利用 "室内绿化来对抗西方大都市的城市工业化......提供一个平行的室内世界......与工业化城市的环境堕落形成对比 "22 然而，正如Gissen所指出的，室内绿化的加入也增加了相关空间的价值。

The Ford Foundation Building consists of twelve storeys of glass, rusted steel and pink granite and contains the oldest large interior atrium garden in the United States,2 Unlike the interior of NorthPark, however, the glazed wall of the atrium partly interfaces with the street. It presents itself as a public space, as well as a facility for the workers in the Foundation's offices. More obviously than the mall. it can also be seen as a giant greenhouse, or winter garden, filled with plants (figs 82 and 83). Given that the building was designed as a cube with an atrium on its southeast side, its essential function as an office was separated from the garden. Senior employees worked in enclosed glass cubicles that looked out onto the interior garden, enabling them to see each other. There was a strong utopian aspect to the garden as it was meant not only to unite the staff but also to provide a peaceful area in which they could relax when they were not working (though there were no benches, and eating there was prohibited). It was also intended to create a green oasis in a city that was in poor economic and environmental condition, and where the trees were dying as a result of pollution.

福特基金会大楼由12层玻璃、生锈的钢和粉红色的花岗岩组成，包含了美国最古老的大型室内中庭花园，2然而与NorthPark的内部不同，中庭的玻璃墙部分与街道对接。它既是一个公共空间，也是基金会办公室的工作人员的设施。比商场更明显的是，它也可以被看作是一个巨大的温室，或冬季花园，充满了植物（图82和83）。鉴于该建筑被设计成一个立方体，在其东南侧有一个中庭，其作为办公室的基本功能被与花园分开。高级员工在封闭的玻璃隔间里工作，可以看到内部的花园，使他们能够看到彼此。这个花园有很强的乌托邦色彩，因为它不仅是为了团结员工，也是为了提供一个宁静的区域，让他们在不工作的时候可以放松（虽然没有长椅，而且禁止在那里吃饭）。这也是为了在一个经济和环境状况不佳的城市创造一片绿洲，那里的树木因污染而逐渐枯萎。

Kevin Roche and John Dinkeloo, who had already worked on the Nieman Marcus store in the NorthPark Center, were the architects of the Ford Foundation Building. Roche had a strong interest in public spaces and public gardens. He also saw the limitations of pre-war modernism. The decision to include a garden in the complex reflects his desire to link architecture with nature. However, it was a tamed, controlled version of nature that interested him, one made possible by technology. Also, as at the Four Seasons and NorthPark, Roche understood that nature could be used to add seasonal variability into otherwise static buildings.

凯文-罗奇和约翰-丁克洛已经参与了北帕克中心的尼曼-马库斯商店的设计，他们是福特基金会大楼的建筑师。罗奇对公共空间和公共花园有着强烈的兴趣。他也看到了战前现代主义的局限性。**在建筑群中加入一个花园的决定反映了他将建筑与自然联系起来的愿望。然而，他感兴趣的是一种被驯服的、受控制的自然，一种由技术实现的自然。**此外，正如在四季酒店和NorthPark一样，罗氏明白，自然可以被用来为其他静态建筑增加季节性变化。

Landscape architect Dan Kiley was introduced into the Ford Foundation indoor-garden team (with whom Roche had already worked at the Oakland Museum, California).25 Kiley had been apprenticed to the landscape architect Warren Manning in the 1930s, and had gone on to study at Harvard alongside Garrett Eckbo. After the war, in 1955, he had worked on the garden of the Miller House in Indianapolis, which featured interior work by Eero Saarinen and Alexander Girard.26 A further continuity was established when the horticulturist and interior landscaper Everett Conklin, who had been involved in the Four Seasons project, was brought in to advise on, install and maintain the greenery in the Ford Foundation Building's indoor garden. The team worked together to create a piece of late-modern commercial architecture that did not merely include plants, but was largely defined by them.

景观设计师Dan Kiley被引入福特基金会的室内花园团队（Roche已经在加州奥克兰博物馆与他合作）。战后，在1955年，他曾为印第安纳波利斯的米勒宅邸设计花园，该宅邸以埃罗-萨里宁和亚历山大-吉拉德的室内作品为特色。26 园艺师和室内景观设计师Everett Conklin曾参与过四季项目，他被邀请为福特基金会大楼室内花园的绿色植物提供建议、安装和维护，这进一步建立了连续性。这个团队共同创造了一件晚期现代商业建筑，它不仅包括植物，而且在很大程度上是由植物决定的。

The skylit, curtain-walled garden that the group created is located in a space 160 feet tall (equal to ten storeys). Its staircase (fig. 84), which is broken into three sections and from which terraces flow, leads down to a square pool of water (figs 85 and 86). There is a 13-foot height difference between the entrances on 42nd and 43rd street. Planters were added on the third, fourth and fifth floors of the building. Following Kiley's vision for the space, and with the help of Conklin, nearly forty trees, 1,000 shrubs and over 22,000 vines and ground-cover plants were installed in the atrium.

该小组创建的天窗、幕墙花园位于160英尺高的空间内（相当于10层楼）。它的楼梯（图84）被分成三个部分，梯田从这里流过，一直通向一个方形的水池（图85和86）。第42街和第43街的入口之间有13英尺的高度差。建筑物的第三、四、五层都增加了花盆。按照凯利对空间的设想，在康克林的帮助下，在中庭安装了近40棵树、1000棵灌木和超过22000棵藤蔓和地被植物。

The aim, in the early years, was to use a range of temperate plants. Eight magnolia trees, each 25-30 feet tall, were brought from Richmond, Virginia, to form the core of the garden. Jacaranda trees, an evergreen pear, a red ironbank and a Japanese cryptomeria were also planted there, as were several camellias and six varieties of azalea, among other plants and flowers. Ornamental ferns and grasses were also used extensively. The lighting, irrigation and drainage were carefully calculated following ideas developed by the Dutch biologist Frits Went. Ada Louise Huxtable described the garden as 'a horticultural spectacular and probably one of the most romantic environments ever devised by corporate man'37

早年的目标是使用一系列的温带植物。八棵玉兰树，每棵都有25-30英尺高，从弗吉尼亚州的里士满运来，形成花园的核心。这里还种植了贾卡兰树、常青梨、红铁树和日本隐花树，以及几株山茶花和六个品种的杜鹃花，还有其他植物和花卉。观赏性的蕨类植物和草也被广泛使用。照明、灌溉和排水都是按照荷兰生物学家弗里茨-温特的想法精心计算的。阿达-路易斯-哈克斯塔布将这个花园描述为 "园艺界的奇观，可能是企业界人士设计的最浪漫的环境之一 "37。

p139

Kiley deliberately over-planted the garden, creating a jungle in which plants would survive as best they could. However, the high humidity and low light levels (the garden is hemmed in by neighbouring skyscrapers, so receives little sun) were not right for the first plants that were chosen and they eventually had to be replaced with subtropicals that were tougher and had a better chance of survival. Ten vears after the garden was completed Conklin explained how they had tried, and largely failed, to grow trees of the southern temperate zone in a tropical or semi-tropical environment as At the time, six of the magnolias were still alive, as were all the camellas, but the three Japanese cryptomerias had died.

凯利故意在花园里种植了过多的植物，创造了一个丛林，让植物尽可能地在其中生存。然而，高湿度和低光照水平（花园被相邻的摩天大楼包围，所以接受的阳光很少）不适合最初选择的植物，最终不得不用更坚韧、更有生存机会的亚热带植物取代它们。花园建成10年后，康克林解释了他们是如何尝试在热带或半热带环境中种植南温带树木的，但基本上是失败的。 当时，六棵木兰花仍然活着，所有的茶花也是如此，但三棵日本隐花已经死亡。

Conklin's article was much more than a statement about the condition of the Ford Foundation garden, however. He also discussed the future of indoor planting, explaining that:

the interior planting specialist of today works very closely with the interior designer, architect, and landscape architect and has not only the ability to interpret the designer's every wish into practical plantings, artistically and functionally arranged, but to maintain those plantings on an unconditional plant replacement guarantee basis, thus eliminating all worries and the responsibility on the part of the owner.

然而，康克林的文章远不止是对福特基金会花园状况的陈述。他还讨论了室内种植的未来，并解释说。

今天的室内种植专家与室内设计师、建筑师和景观设计师密切合作，不仅有能力将设计师的每一个愿望转化为实用的植物，在艺术上和功能上进行安排，而且在无条件更换植物的基础上维护这些植物，从而消除了业主的所有顾虑和责任。

p141

He went on to say that he did see a future for the interior planting business, though he was not sure whether it would be in the hands of the outdoor planting people and nurserymen or the interior planting specialists. He sensed it would be the latter. In either case, 'Indoor plants and trees are here to stay, especially in our city buildings', he proclaimed prophetically.39

他接着说，他确实看到了室内种植业务的未来，尽管他不确定这是否会掌握在户外种植者和苗圃者手中，还是掌握在室内种植专家手中。他觉得会是后者。不管是哪种情况，"室内植物和树木都会存在，特别是在我们的城市建筑中"，他预言道。

As well as predicting what was soon to become a massive industry, Conklin was far-sighted enough to understand that a huge shift was taking place in terms of the relationship between human beings and nature. He went as far as to claim, again presciently, that 'In the absence of plants and flowers in some of our interiors we may be producing undesirable side effects that, if allowed to proceed unchecked, may result in the erosion of the psychological environment, the erosion of human life.'30

除了预测很快就会成为一个庞大的产业外，康克林还很有远见地了解到，在人类与自然的关系方面正在发生巨大的转变。他甚至再次有预见性地声称，"在我们的一些室内没有植物和花卉的情况下，我们可能会产生不良的副作用，如果任其发展，可能会导致心理环境的侵蚀，人类生活的侵蚀。

Through the 1960s and beyond, countless large public and semi-public buildings across urban America had plants and flowers introduced into their inside spaces. The IBM Building, opened in 1983 at 590 Madison Avenue in New York, was among the many to contain numerous plants huge bamboo trees, in this case - in their indoor atria (fig. 87). 'By the late 1980s' wrote David Gissen, 'the sheer volume of plants being grown throughout New York City and other cities made the indoor atmosphere of late-modern architecture a new lens through which to re-evaluate the natural and productive capacities of architecture more generally'3' As ever, nature inside was used to a number of different ends, among them softening and humanising the monumentality of late-modern architecture and encouraging consumption by making it a more relaxing and enjoyable experience. Whether these were 'corporate arcadias' for the many, or whether they were there only for the chosen few and, once again in Gissen's words, simply 'reinforced] the trade systems and political relationships that underpin[ned] the modern experience' was widely debated. 32

在20世纪60年代及以后，美国城市中无数的大型公共和半公共建筑在其内部空间中引入了植物和花卉。1983年开业的位于纽约麦迪逊大道590号的IBM大厦，是在其室内中庭种植大量植物的大厦之一（图87）。David Gissen写道："到了80年代末，纽约市和其他城市种植的大量植物使晚期现代建筑的室内氛围成为一个新的视角，通过它可以重新评估建筑的自然和生产能力"。这些是为许多人服务的 "企业竞技场"，还是只为少数人服务，用Gissen的话说，只是 "加强了 "支撑现代经验的贸易体系和政治关系"，这一点引起了广泛的讨论。32

Like the NorthPark Center and the Ford Foundation Building, many other buildings of the era turned their backs on the urban problems outside their walls and used nature inside as a means of creating an enclosed and private fantasy world. One such was the Hvatt Regency Hotel, the subject of the following chapter, which was designed by John Portman and opened in Atlanta in 1967.

像NorthPark中心和福特基金会大楼一样，这个时代的许多其他建筑都背弃了墙外的城市问题，而将墙内的自然作为创造一个封闭和私人幻想世界的手段。下一章的主题--Hvatt Regency酒店就是其中之一，它由约翰-波特曼设计，于1967年在亚特兰大开业。

Nature in the West is instrumentalised as a mere means to human ends.1
Val Plumwood

西方的自然被工具化，仅仅是实现人类目的的一种手段。
Val Plumwood

As the previous two chapters have shown, the 1960s witnessed the introduction of nature into a range of large, public-sphere, indoor commercial environments in North America. Through the following decade that trend spread globally. In response to the financial investment made by the managers of those spaces, and in recognition of a growing general interest in the benefits of indoor plants, researchers in a range of adjacent fields set out to provide evidence of the effects of nature inside. The focus was on its potential to improve people's mental and physical health and well-being, as well as on its benefits for the environment. The commercial world's interest in the work being undertaken lay in the effect that indoor plants had on production in offices, consumption in retail and other commercial settings, and efficiency in hospitals, prisons and several other institutions. If people were happier and healthier, it was believed, they would work harder and better, spend more, and require less support, all of which boosted the financial bottom line.

如前两章所示，**20世纪60年代，在北美，自然界被引入一系列大型公共场所的室内商业环境中。在接下来的十年里，这一趋势蔓延到了全球。为了响应这些空间的管理者所做的财政投资，并认识到人们对室内植物的好处的兴趣日益增长，一系列相邻领域的研究人员开始提供自然界在室内的影响的证据。重点是其改善人们身心健康和福祉的潜力，以及其对环境的好处。商业界对正在进行的工作的兴趣在于室内植物对办公室的生产、零售和其他商业环境的消费，以及医院、监狱和其他一些机构的效率的影响。人们相信，如果人们更快乐、更健康，他们会更努力、更好地工作，花费更多，需要更少的支持，所有这些都会提高财务底线。**

The desire to develop scientific models with which to examine the natural world recalls the rise of botanical science in the eighteenth century, and the work undertaken at that time by Carl Linnaeus and others to categorise plants systematically. By the 1970s, however, it was the psychological rather than the biological sciences that provided the baseline for debates and discussions about the benefits of tamed nature. In the eighteenth century, human beings had exploited tamed plants commercially by integrating them into the colonial economy. In the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, turning to science to provide a rationale for institutions and commercial operations to invest in indoor plants represented a new form of exploitation of the natural world for economic ends. Of course, the growing number of nurseries that supplied indoor plants and flowers, and the indoor landscapers who installed and maintained them, also benefited from the expansion of their businesses.

**开发科学模型来研究自然界的愿望让人想起十八世纪植物学的兴起，以及卡尔-林奈和其他人当时为系统地分类植物所做的工作。**然而**，到了20世纪70年代，是心理学而不是生物科学为有关驯服自然的好处的辩论和讨论提供了基线。在18世纪，人类通过将驯服的植物纳入殖民经济来对其进行商业开发。在二十世纪末和二十一世纪初，转向科学，为机构和商业运作提供投资室内植物的理由，代表了一种为经济目的开发自然界的新形式。当然，越来越多的供应室内植物和花卉的苗圃，以及安装和维护这些植物的室内园艺师，也从其业务的扩展中受益**。

On the back of this growth emerged a new profession, which was increasingly referred to as 'interiorscaping' or 'plantscaping! While its practitioners were initially self-taught, formal educational systems were soon established. In addition to the members of architectural and landscape firms who worked on indoor foliage, several other individuals began to thrive as plantscapers. Everett Conklin was among the early pioneers, as was the New Jersey-based Roehrs family. Having started out in orchid-growing, the family had formed a business in 1869 and, by the early twentieth century, was running one of the largest nurseries supplying plants for indoor purposes. In the 1960s Julius Roehrs went to work in the Kentia palm industry in California. The Roehrs company also published books by the tropical-plant authority Alfred Graf (fig. 98), one of whose many claims was that the practice of bringing plants into the workplace had begun when women entered it (fig. 99).7

在这种增长的背景下，出现了一个新的行业，它被越来越多的人称为 "室内景观 "或 "植物景观 越来越多地被称为 "室内景观 "或 "植物景观"。虽然 其从业人员最初是自学成才，但正式的教育系统 很快就建立起来了。除了建筑和景观公司的成员外，还有 除了建筑和景观公司的成员从事室内叶子的工作外，其他几个人 也开始作为植物种植者蓬勃发展。Everett Conklin是早期的 和位于新泽西州的Roehrs家族一样，也是早期的先驱者。在开始时 该家族以种植兰花起家，于1869年成立了一个企业，到20世纪初，该家族已经成为了世界上最大的兰花种植商。到二十世纪初，他们经营着最大的苗圃之一 供应室内用的植物。在20世纪60年代，Julius Roehrs去了 在加利福尼亚的Kentia棕榈业工作。Roehrs公司 还出版了热带植物权威Alfred Graf的书籍（图98）。他的许多主张之一是，将植物带入工作场所的做法是从妇女进入工作场所开始的。他的许多主张之一是，将植物带入工作场所的做法是从妇女进入工作场所开始的（图99）。

In 1974 an American landscape architect named Nelson Hammer convinced The Architects Collaborative, a company for which he was working at the time, to employ Conklin to help them install a lobby garden in a hotel in the Middle East.3 While working for Dan Kiley a few years earlier, Hammer had become familiar with Conklin's interior landscaping at the Ford Foundation Building. He learnt a great deal from working alongside Conklin on the Middle East project, and afterwards went on to undertake a number of interior-landscaping projects himself, claiming that his main learning method was 'trial and error'4 By 1992, though, he was able to observe that there were 'several excellent books and two national magazines devoted to the subject' as well as a number of university courses. Both developments suggest that plantscaping was beginning to acquire a serious professional profile. s

1974年，一位名叫Nelson Hammer的美国景观设计师说服了他当时效力的The Architects Collaborative公司，聘请Conklin帮助他们在中东的一家酒店安装一个大堂花园。他在中东项目中与康克林一起工作，学到了很多东西，之后他自己也进行了一些室内景观设计项目，他声称他的主要学习方法是 "试验和错误 "4，但到1992年，他能够观察到有 "几本优秀的书籍和两本专门讨论这个问题的国家杂志 "以及一些大学课程。这两方面的发展都表明，植物景观设计已经开始获得一个严肃的专业形象。

**Richard L. Gaines's Interior Plantscaping: Building Design for Interior Foliage Plants (1977)** was one of the earliest books to lay out the principles of the new professional practice. As the author explained, the terms 'interiorscaping, 'interior landscaping' and 'interior plantscaping' were used interchangeably at that time, though he personally favoured the last;? The main problem to be addressed, in his eyes, was the gap between the Interior-landscaping industry, with its horticultural knowledge, and the design profession - architects and interior designers, in particular - which, up until that point, had tried to develop plantscapes on its own. While interior landscapers understood plants' needs but had no real design skills, claimed Gaines, designers did not understand the principles of what he called 'plant material'& In order to meet the requirements of the rapidly expanding field, in which ever-larger financial investments were being made, he stressed the importance of collaboration. While books about domestic houseplants existed, Gaines explained, there was little that addressed the commercial sector.° He wanted his book to help the design profession understand how to work with foliage plants indoors, how to specify them, and how to ensure that adequate maintenance programmes were in place. He was adamant that the requirements for lighting, water supply, drainage, temperature and humidity needed to be included at the early design stage a necessity that, in his view, had been overlooked in the past.

**理查德-L-盖恩斯的《室内植物景观》。室内观叶植物的建筑设计》（1977年）是最早阐述新专业实践原则的书籍之一。**正如作者所解释的那样，"室内园艺"、"室内景观 "和 "室内植物景观 "这几个词在当时是可以互换使用的，不过他个人更倾向于最后一个词；? 在他眼里，需要解决的主要问题是，拥有园艺知识的室内景观设计行业与设计行业--尤其是建筑师和室内设计师--之间的差距，在那之前，后者一直试图自行开发植物景观。盖恩斯称，**室内园艺师了解植物的需求，但没有真正的设计技能，而设计师则不了解他所谓的 "植物材料 "的原理，**为了满足这个迅速扩大的领域的要求，他强调合作的重要性。他希望他的书能够帮助设计行业了解如何在室内使用观叶植物，如何指定它们，以及如何确保有足够的维护方案。他坚持认为，照明、供水、排水、温度和湿度的要求需要在早期设计阶段就包括在内，在他看来，这种必要性在过去被忽视了。

Gaines felt that as the pace of life increased, 'people need[ed] something to hold on to'. The use of indoor foliage plants was, therefore, not only fashionable but also necessary. to Beyond acting as visual screens, softening hard architectural surfaces, providing texture, articulating spatial volume, directing circulation and improving morale, Gaines firmly maintained that 'indoor foliage plants [were] symbolic of life itself and a denial of death?" His words, which went to the core of the rationale for engaging with nature inside, touched on something that had been understood, albeit silently, for several centuries. While it was in plantscapers interests to claim that plants were more than mere decoration in an interior setting, Gaines was one of a group who increasingly understood the importance of nature to human beings' very existence.

盖恩斯认为，随着生活节奏的加快，"人们需要一些东西来坚持下去"。因此，室内观叶植物的使用不仅是时尚的，而且是必要的。除了作为视觉屏障、软化坚硬的建筑表面、提供纹理、衔接空间体积、引导流通和提高士气之外，盖恩斯坚定地认为，**"室内观叶植物[是]生命本身的象征，是对死亡的否定？**" **他的话涉及到在室内与自然接触的理由的核心，触及了几个世纪以来一直被理解的东西，**尽管是默默的。虽然声称植物在室内环境中不仅仅是装饰，这符合植物学家的利益，但盖恩斯是越来越理解自然对人类生存的重要性的群体之一。

From 1976 onwards George H. Manaker taught a course in interior planting at Temple University in Philadelphia. In 1981 he published a textbook for his students in which he explained that much more training in the new field was needed. 'While advice was available for the "window sill' gardener', he explained, 'the student or practitioner of plantscaping. requires a comprehensive knowledge of the interior environment and its manipulation.!'12 Manaker was fully aware of the important link between plantscaping and environmentalism. 'Interior planting is not a fad; he wrote. 'It is part of the back-to-earth, back-to-nature, back-to-the-senses movements evolving in culture today. Indoor plants may no longer be non-essential luxuries, but necessities just as our automotive and television sets are "necessary" playing a very important role in the American way of life?13 In 1983 Tok Furuta, another practitioner in the field, penned his own influential book directed at the plantscaping profession. It offered practical advice about how to position plants in offices and shopping malls to maximum effect (fig. 100), 14

从1976年起，George H. Manaker在费城的天普大学教授室内种植课程。1981年，他为他的学生出版了一本教科书，其中他解释说，在这个新领域需要更多的培训。他解释说，"虽然可以为'窗台'园丁提供建议，但'植物景观的学生或从业者需要对室内环境及其操作有全面的了解！'12 **Manaker充分意识到植物景观与环境主义之间的重要联系。室内种植不是一种时尚；他写道。它是当今文化中发展的回归大地、回归自然、回归感官运动的一部分。室内植物可能不再是非必要的奢侈品，而是必需品，就像我们的汽车和电视机是 "必需的"，在美国的生活方式中扮演着非常重要的角色。**它提供了关于如何在办公室和购物中心摆放植物以达到最大效果的实用建议（图100），14

The plantscaping profession continued to expand in the United States through subsequent decades, much of it based near to the supply of plants in Florida and California. Planterra, established in 1973, and Plantscape House Inc., founded in 1980, were just two of the many commercial plantscaping operations formed at that time. By 1986 there were approximately 8,000 interior landscape companies in the United States, many of them one- or two-person operations, and about the same number again outside the country (fig. 101). Their work was made possible by the rapid development of new high-tech products, such as pressurised watering tanks and sub-irrigation systems.

在随后的几十年里，植物景观行业在美国继续扩大，其中大部分是基于佛罗里达和加利福尼亚的植物供应。1973年成立的Planterra和1980年成立的Plantscape House Inc.只是当时成立的众多商业植物景观业务中的两个。到1986年，美国大约有8000家室内景观公司，其中许多是一人或两人经营的，在国外也有大约同样的数量（图101）。他们的工作因新的高科技产品的迅速发展而成为可能，如加压浇水箱和分灌系统。

p168

In the first two decades of the twenty-first century, the number of plantscapers and designers who had taken on board the ideas articulated by Gaines, Manaker, Furuta and others increased dramatically worldwide. In Brighton, England, for example, the team working with the designer Oliver Heath have been employed across a range of interiors, from offices to hospitality spaces, education spaces, healthcare spaces, retail spaces and homes. Heath's projects included a striking installation at the Interface Showroom for Clerkenwell Design Week (2016), which featured a vertical planted wall. Working with nature inside forms part of Heath's wider approach towards designing for health and well-being, which, following the discoveries of the 1970s, also includes improving natural light, facilitating views out on to nature, incorporating natural materials, textures and patterns, and ventilating spaces. 15 In 2017 Heath was commissioned to create a meditation studio in London, named Re:Mind, which is linked to a retail space and a tea-tasting area. It contains a green wall designed by the British company Biotecture, and a rock-salt light installation believed to be able to remove toxins from the air (fig. 102). In order to persuade his clients of the benefits - human, environmental and economic - of engaging with nature inside, like the scientists working from the 1970s onwards, Heath backs up his work with rigorous research.

在二十一世纪的头二十年里，全世界接受了盖恩斯、马纳克、古田等人阐述的理念的植物学家和设计师的数量急剧增加。例如，在英国布莱顿，与设计师奥利弗-希斯（Oliver Heath）合作的团队已被雇用于一系列的室内装饰，从办公室到酒店空间、教育空间、保健空间、零售空间和住宅。Heath的项目包括为Clerkenwell设计周（2016年）在Interface展示厅的一个引人注目的装置，其特点是垂直种植墙。在室内与自然合作构成了Heath为健康和幸福而设计的更广泛方法的一部分，根据20世纪70年代的发现，这也包括改善自然光，促进对自然的看法，结合自然材料、纹理和图案，以及空间的通风。15 2017年，Heath被委托在伦敦创建一个名为Re:Mind的冥想工作室，它与一个零售空间和品茶区相连。它包含一个由英国公司Biotecture设计的绿色墙面，以及一个被认为能够去除空气中毒素的岩盐灯光装置（图102）。为了说服他的客户相信在室内与自然接触的好处--人类的、环境的和经济的，像70年代以来的科学家一样，希思用严格的研究来支持他的工作。

**Heath fully embraces the concept of biophilia in the interior,** **a topic which has been discussed since the 1960s. The term was coined by the psychologist Erich Fromm in his 1964 book,** **The Heart of Man, in which he defined it as a 'psychological orientation of being attracted to all that is alive and vital'**16 In the 1970s Conklin had been a strong advocate of humankind's inherent link to nature, publishing an influential article in the American Nurseryman Magazine entitled 'Man and Plants A Primal Association' in 1972, in which he outlined the idea that people are genetically programmed to be near green, growing plants. 17 Two years later Conklin developed the same ideas in another article published in the same journal, and in 1978 he expressed his heartfelt belief that man is inherently unhappy in an environment in which there is an absence of plants and flowers:18 Conklin's intuitive approach was based on his childhood experiences of living on a farm. "I knew the bay of the fox .. I knew the inspiration of nature's foliage and flowers. It all seems lost now in our man-made cities', he explained regretfully."9 On one level, Conklin was articulating a reason why people might employ him and his fellow plantscapers. On another, his words were part of a broader cultural movement that focused on human beings' need to remain close to nature.

希思完全接受了**室内生物亲和力的概念**，这个话题从1960年代就开始被讨论。**这个术语是由心理学家埃里希-弗洛姆在他1964年出版的《人类的心》一书中提出的，他在书中把它定义为 "被所有有生命力的东西所吸引的心理取向"。**17 两年后，康克林在同一杂志上发表的另一篇文章中提出了同样的观点。1978年，他表达了自己发自内心的信念，即在缺乏植物和花卉的环境中，人天生就不快乐。18 康克林的直觉方法是基于他童年在农场生活的经历。"我知道狐狸的海湾......我知道大自然的树叶和花朵的灵感。他遗憾地解释说："现在在我们的人造城市中，这一切似乎都消失了。"9 在一个层面上，康克林正在阐述人们可能雇用他和他的植物学家同伴的原因。在另一个层面上，他的话是更广泛的文化运动的一部分，该运动关注的是人类需要保持与自然的亲近。

p169

In 1984 Edward O. Wilson published a book, Biophilia, in which, like Conklin before him, he articulated an evolutionary approach, defining biophilia as 'the innate tendency to focus on life and lifelike processes,20 Wilson was a biologist with a special interest in the behaviour of ants, and it was while he was undertaking fieldwork that he became aware of the calming and mysterious effect of the natural world, which, he claimed, 'is to be mastered but never (we hope) completely!2 Later in the book he admitted that 'we only think we have control', revealing himself to be one of the first in the field to recognise the agency of the natural world and the need for human beings to re-establish a balanced relationship with it. 22

**1984年，爱德华-威尔逊（Edward O. Wilson）出版了一本名为《生物亲和力》（Biophilia）的书**，在书中，他像之前的康克林一样，阐述了一种进化的方法，将生物亲和力定义为 **"关注生命和生命过程的先天倾向，20 威尔逊是一位生物学家，对蚂蚁的行为特别感兴趣，正是在他进行实地考察时，他意识到了自然世界的平静和神秘的效果，他声称，"要掌握，但永远（我们希望）不能完全掌握！2 在书的后面，他承认 "我们只认为我们有控制权"，这表明他是这个领域中最早认识到自然界的作用以及人类需要与之重建平衡关系的人之一。22**

Wilson believed that human beings' affiliation with life included an innate aesthetic response to nature and an instinctive desire to recreate it in the form of landscapes and gardens. "Some environments are indeed pleasant, he explained, 'for the same general reason that sugar is sweet, incest and cannibalism repulsive, and team sports exhilarating. Such response has its peculiar meaning rooted in the distant genetic past.'23 Referencing the work of Leo Marx, he regretted the fact that humankind had followed the path of the machine, which, he felt. had driven a wedge between nature and culture and initiated man's destruction of the former. 'It is, he wrote evocatively, like burning a Renaissance painting to cook dinner! 24

**威尔逊认为，人类对生命的归属感包括对自然的先天审美反应，以及以景观和花园的形式重新创造自然的本能欲望。他解释说："有些环境确实令人愉快，'就像糖是甜的，乱伦和吃人是令人厌恶的，而团队运动是令人振奋的一般原因一样。这种反应有其特殊的意义，植根于遥远的遗传历史。"23 在提到列奥-马克思的工作时，他对人类走了机器的道路感到遗憾，他认为机器在自然和文化之间制造了一个楔子，启动了人类对前者的破坏。**他唤醒地写道："这就像烧掉一幅文艺复兴时期的画来做晚饭！"。24

p170

For Wilson, the split between science and the humanities, and the dominance of the former, lay at the core of the problem. He was also dismissive about nature transformed into culture. 'Lawn grass, potted plants, caged parakeets, puppies and rubber snakes are not enough', he maintained. 25 Only nature in its wild state was acceptable to him. Along with Stephen Kellert, Wilson edited The Biophilia Hypothesis, a book of essays published in 1993. Covering a wide spectrum of subjects addressed from psychological, biological, cultural, symbolic and aesthetic perspectives, it set out to rationalise the innate and, in order to move away from what some considered romantic idealisation, to provide evidence for the existence of biophilia. 26 The hypothesis was now formulated as "a human dependence on nature that extends far beyond the simple issues of material and physical sustenance to encompass as well the human craving for aesthetic, intellectual, cognitive, and even spiritual meaning and satisfaction' Biophilia, it was suggested, was rooted in historic learning and persisted even in people who had lived in urban environments for several generations. 27 It was implied that the satisfaction of that craving led to psychological well-being, reduced stress levels, and promoted physical health.

对威尔逊来说，科学和人文之间的分裂，以及前者的主导地位，是问题的核心所在。他还对自然界转化为文化的做法不屑一顾。他认为，"草坪上的草、盆栽、笼中的鹦鹉、小狗和橡胶蛇是不够的"。25 对他来说，只有野生状态的自然才是可以接受的。**Wilson和Stephen Kellert一起编辑了《生物多样性假说》，这是一本1993年出版的论文集。该书涵盖了从心理学、生物学、文化学、象征学和美学角度探讨的广泛主题，旨在使天生的东西合理化，为了摆脱一些人认为的浪漫的理想化，为生物亲和力的存在提供证据。**26 **这一假设现在被表述为 "人类对自然的依赖，远远超出了简单的物质和身体维持问题，还包括了人类对审美、智力、认知、甚至精神意义和满足的渴望。27 这意味着对这种渴望的满足会导致心理健康，减少压力水平，并促进身体健康。**

From the mid-1970s onwards, bodies of urbanists, architects, landscape architects, interior designers and plantscapers began to ask serious questions about the benefits of plants in indoor spaces. Taking up the gauntlet that had been thrown down by Wilson and others - and in support of the work of the professionals involved, the industry that supplied the plants, and the institutions and commercial clients who invested in plants for their spaces - a number of environmental psychologists, clinical psychologists, sociologists, health specialists and others working in behavioural medicine began to develop theories about the effects of plants inside on human beings. Many of them expressed their ideas in evolutionary terms, claiming that 'the long evolutionary development of humankind in natural environments has left its mark on our species in the form of unlearned predispositions to pay attention and respond positively to the contents of those environments'28 They also believed that the restorative effects of plants were cross-cultural.

从20世纪70年代中期开始，城市学家、建筑师、景观设计师、室内设计师和园艺师们开始认真询问植物在室内空间的益处。为了支持相关专业人员的工作，支持提供植物的行业，支持为其空间投资植物的机构和商业客户，一些环境心理学家、临床心理学家、社会学家、健康专家和其他行为医学工作者开始发展关于室内植物对人类影响的理论。他们中的许多人用进化论的术语来表达他们的想法，声称 "人类在自然环境中的长期进化发展在我们这个物种身上留下了印记，其形式是未经学习的倾向性，即关注和积极响应这些环境的内容 "28 他们还认为，植物的恢复性效果是跨文化的。

'Overload' and 'arousal' theories were two of the early justifications for bringing plants inside. Both are premised on the notion that 'environments with high levels of visual complexity, noise, intensity  and movement' can be overwhelming but that restoration can be achieved and stress relieved by the calming effects of indoor plants.3 The environmental psychologists Rachel and Stephen Kaplan, who were based at the University of Michigan, were awarded funding in the 1970s by the United States Forest Service to work on Michigan's wilderness. Interested in the effect of nature on people's relationships and health they developed what they dubbed 'Attention Restoration Therapy' Rooted in the belief that nature had 'high fascination value', it provided, they maintained, a remedy for mental fatigue.

**超载 "和 "唤醒 "理论是早期将植物引入室内的两个理由。这两种理论的前提是，"具有高度视觉复杂性、噪音、强度和运动的环境 "可能会使人不堪重负，但通过室内植物的镇静作用，可以实现恢复并缓解压力。他们对自然对人际关系和健康的影响很感兴趣，开发了被称为 "注意力恢复疗法 "的疗法，他们认为自然具有 "高度的吸引力"，这为精神疲劳提供了一种补救办法。**

Roger S. Ulrich's main interest also lay in the links between interior environments and health. Although his background was in the social sciences, he moved into the area of evidence-based design. After a period spent in Sweden, in 1988 he became a professor of architecture at Texas A&M University, where he helped to establish the Center for Health Systems and Design. Although he also adopted an evolutionary approach, unlike the Kaplans, Ulrich maintained that human beings' responses to natural environments were not registered consciously but were, rather, "quick on-set affective or emotional reactions:3 His work was linked to studies of the emotions being undertaken at the time, as well as to contemporary developments in neurobiology.

罗杰-S-乌尔里希的主要兴趣还在于室内环境和健康之间的联系。尽管他的背景是社会科学，但他还是进入了循证设计领域。在瑞典呆了一段时间后，1988年他成为德克萨斯A&M大学的建筑学教授，在那里他帮助建立了健康系统和设计中心。尽管他也采用了进化论的方法，但与Kaplans不同，**Ulrich坚持认为人类对自然环境的反应不是有意识的，而是 "快速设定的情感或情绪反应：3 他的工作与当时正在进行的情感研究，以及当代神经生物学的发展有关。**

Through the final two decades of the twentieth century, and the first decade of the twenty-first, many other researchers measured pulses, heartbeats, blood pressure, muscle contractions and immunoglobulin levels, and undertook brain scans, in their attempts to provide scientific evidence of human beings' responses to the natural world, both outside and inside buildings. The work was conducted in the United States, the United kingdom, Norway, Sweden, Japan, the Netherlands and China, among other countries, and the results were published in global academic iournals." Hard evidence was needed not only to justify the funding tinat went into the research, but also to reassure all those who wanted to invest in plantscaping that it paid for itself, either indirectly by creating efficiencies, or directly by resulting in financial profit

在二十世纪的最后二十年和二十一世纪的第一个十年中，许多其他研究人员测量了脉搏、心跳、血压、肌肉收缩和免疫球蛋白水平，并进行了大脑扫描，试图为人类对自然界的反应提供科学证据，包括在建筑物外部和内部。这项工作在美国、英国、挪威、瑞典、日本、荷兰和中国以及其他国家进行，其结果发表在全球学术期刊上。我们需要确凿的证据，不仅是为了证明投入研究的资金，也是为了让所有想投资植物景观的人放心，因为它可以通过创造效率间接获得回报，或者直接带来经济利益。

"The experiments focused on a range of specific interiors - including offices, hospitals and prisons, and, a little later, hospitality and retail spaces - in which well-being was an important issue. Since the 1960s Dlants had played an important role in what was described at that time as the landscaped office, or Bürolandschaft, a concept developed by a German space-planning firm called Quickborner (figs 103-5). The firm was owned by the brothers Wolfgang and Eberhard Schnelle, who had set out to create an office system that functioned on a human scale and was more flexible than the hierarchically arranged rows of desks that had previouslv been the norm.32 A range of plants, including dracaenas, philodendrons, yuccas, weeping figs, Kentia palms, umbrella trees, fatsias, rubber plants. Swiss cheese plants, ivies and bamboos were introduced into landscaped offices. They served multiple purposes, including absorbing noise, replacing partitions, providing a level of privacy and acting as directional signs, and played several aesthetic roles, among them creating focal points, filling voids, and adding colour, texture and warmth.

"实验的重点是一系列具体的室内装饰--包括 包括办公室、医院和监狱，以及稍后的酒店和零售空间。空间--其中福祉是一个重要问题。自20世纪60年代以来 Dlants在当时被称为 "景观办公室 "的项目中发挥了重要作用。景观办公室，或称Bürolandschaft，一个由德国空间规划公司Quborbor提出的概念。德国空间规划公司Quickborner提出的概念（图103-5）。该公司的老板是 该公司由Wolfgang和Eberhard Schnelle兄弟拥有。他们的目标是创造一个以人为本的办公系统，比等级排列的排房更灵活。他们想创造一种办公系统，使其在人的规模上发挥作用，并比以前的一排排办公桌更加灵活。32 一系列的植物，包括龙爪兰、紫荆花、玉兰、垂枝等。32 一系列的植物，包括龙爪兰、丝兰、无花果、Kentia棕榈、伞形树、法桐、橡胶植物。瑞士奶酪植物、常春藤和竹子被引入景观设计中。办公室。它们有多种用途，包括吸收噪音、取代隔断、提供一定程度的隐私。隔断，提供一定程度的隐私，并作为方向指示牌，而且 它们还发挥了一些美学作用，其中包括创造焦点、填补空隙、增加颜色和质地。空隙，并增加颜色、纹理和温暖。

In the early 1960s the German project came to the notice of an American researcher named Robert Propst, who was working along similar lines for the Herman Miller company in the United States. In 1964 Herman Miller launched a new concept called 'Action Office', on which Propst collaborated with the designer George Nelson. The first Quickborner office landscape in America was created for Dupont in Wilmington, Delaware, in 1967.33 Subsequently, plants played an important role in numerous office projects across the globe that emulated the work undertaken in Germany and the United States (fig. 106).

在20世纪60年代初，这个德国项目引起了一位名叫罗伯特-普罗普斯特的美国研究员的注意，他正在为美国的赫尔曼-米勒公司从事类似的工作。1964年，赫曼米勒公司推出了一个名为 "行动办公室 "的新概念，普罗普斯特与设计师乔治-纳尔逊合作，对其进行了研究。1967年，美国第一个Quickborner办公室景观是为特拉华州威尔明顿的杜邦公司设计的。33随后，植物在全球众多的办公室项目中发挥了重要作用，这些项目都是模仿德国和美国的工作（图106）。

Serious research on the effects of plants in offices began in the early 1970s. By 1978 Conklin was able to claim that 'attitudes in the planted office seem to indicate individual and collective morale very much improved and absenteeism considerably down'34 At that time the energy crisis was forcing builders to turn to more efficient products for construction, and office buildings were being hermetically sealed. The new materials that they used contained toxins that led to a multiple-symptom disorder in office workers known as 'sick building syndrome! As a result, in addition to the work being done on plants as stress relievers, research was also undertaken to address their capacity to combat air pollution.

对办公室内植物效果的认真研究开始于20世纪70年代初。**到了1978年，康克林声称 "在种植了植物的办公室里，个人和集体的士气似乎都有了很大的提高，缺勤率也大大降低 "34 当时，能源危机迫使建筑商转向更有效的建筑产品，而办公楼则被密封起来。他们使用的新材料含有毒素，导致办公人员出现多种症状，被称为 "病态建筑综合症！"。**因此，除了正在进行的关于植物作为压力缓解剂的工作之外，还进行了研究，以解决其对抗空气污染的能力。

Research on the effects of plants on office workers continued into the 1990s. In 1993 Rachel Kaplan reworked her ideas about 'nearby nature' and 'mental fatigue!35 Her rather vague conclusion was that: **To be able to glance up from one's work and experience bits of nature is likely to be helpful!**'s Five years later a group of Norwegian researchers described the result of a study that had asked workers twelve questions relating to their health. From their responses the researchers reached the conclusion that complaints regarding coughs and fatigue were reduced by thirty seven and Thirty per cent respectively if the office contained plants'»7 By the early twenty-first century the computer had become a key feature of the office and, in 2015, using stress-recovery and attention-restoration theories to analyse their findings, another group of Norwegian researchers reported that' participants who had plants present at the workstation showed an improvement in their performance of a directed attention task over time, while participants who sat in a lean control environment did not'3:

关于植物对办公人员影响的研究一直持续到20世纪90年代。1993年，雷切尔-卡普兰重新修改了她关于 "附近的自然 "和 "精神疲劳 "的观点！35她相当模糊的结论是："**能够从工作中抬起头来，体验一下大自然，可能会有帮助！**。**五年后，一组挪威研究人员描述了一项研究的结果，该研究向工人提出了12个与他们的健康有关的问题。根据他们的回答，研究人员得出结论，如果办公室里有植物，关于咳嗽和疲劳的抱怨分别减少了37%和30%。"7 到21世纪初，电脑已经成为办公室的一个主要特征，2015年，另一组挪威研究人员使用压力恢复和注意力恢复理论来分析他们的发现，"工作站上有植物的参与者显示他们在定向注意力任务中的表现随着时间的推移有所改善，而坐在精益控制环境中的参与者则没有。

A 1976 paper addressed the role of plants inside a psychiatric hospital.3 Two years later, Conklin described an experiment that a group of researchers had undertaken at the Dunlap Psychiatric Hospital in New York City, in which a number of patients had been exposed to flowering chrysanthemum plants that had been casually placed on several dining tables, while the other tables in the room had nothing on them. The research concluded that eleven per cent of the people sitting at a table with a plant on it had eaten more than the others; twenty-one per cent had spent more time at the table; and thirty-three per cent had conversed more with their fellow patients. That was taken, rather simplistically perhaps, as proof of the benefits of indoor planting. The sophistication of experiments of that kind was to increase over the years, however, as more probing questions were asked, controls were added, and the test results were analysed more rigorously.

两年后，康克林描述了一组研究人员在纽约市邓拉普精神病院进行的一项实验，其中一些病人被暴露在开花的菊花植物中，这些植物被随意地放在几张餐桌上，而房间里的其他桌子上什么都没有。研究得出的结论是，坐在有植物的桌子上的人中，有11%的人比其他人吃得更多；21%的人在桌子上花了更多的时间；33%的人与他们的病友交谈得更多。这被认为是室内种植的好处的证明，也许是比较简单的。然而，随着更多的问题被提出，控制被添加，测试结果被更严格地分析，这类实验的复杂性将在几年内增加。

In 1984 Ulrich had suggested that the sight of nature outside hospital wards could help alleviate anxiety or stress.4 Over two decades later the researchers Seong-Hyun Park and Richard H. Mattson took the work one step further by testing the medical and psychological effects of plants and flowers that had been introduced into the hospital rooms of post-operative female patients. Patients with plants in their rooms were found to have had 'shorter hospitalisations, less need for analgesics, lower ratings of pain, anxiety and fatigue, and more positive feelings', compared to those without plants. A' The work claimed to prove what the Victorians, who had filled their hospital wards with flowers, had undoubtedly known intuitively (fig. 107). The Khoo Teck Puat hospital, which opened in Singapore in 2010, is surrounded by plants inside and out, while the Crown Sky Garden in the Ann & Robert H. Lure Children's Hospital in Chicago, opened in 2012, also aims to have a relaxing effect. Within a glass greenhouse perched high up on the eleventh floor of the building, the designer, Mikyoung Kim, combined light, water and colour with bamboo groves, marble fountains, natural stone and reclaimed Wood.« The same approach was taken to childcare facilities, in which plants Were seen to enhance the experiences of the children who inhabited them. The privately run John Hancock Child Care Center in Boston in the United States, which opened in 1990, contained a densely planted interior garden.

1984年，乌尔里希提出，在医院病房外看到大自然可以帮助缓解焦虑或压力。4 20多年后，研究人员Seong-Hyun Park和Richard H. Mattson将这项工作向前推进了一步，测试了被引入手术后女性患者病房的植物和花卉的医疗和心理效果。与没有植物的病人相比，房间里有植物的病人被发现 "住院时间更短，对镇痛剂的需求更少，对疼痛、焦虑和疲劳的评价更低，并且有更积极的感觉"。A'这项工作声称证明了维多利亚时代的人，他们在医院的病房里种满了鲜花，无疑是凭直觉知道的（图107）。2010年在新加坡开业的邱德拔医院内外都被植物所包围，而2012年在芝加哥开业的安和罗伯特-H-卢尔儿童医院的皇冠空中花园也旨在产生一种放松的效果。在建筑11层高处的玻璃温室内，设计师Mikyoung Kim将光线、水和色彩与竹林、大理石喷泉、天然石材和再生木材结合起来。同样的方法也被用于儿童保育设施，在这些设施中，植物被认为可以增强居住在其中的儿童的体验。位于美国波士顿的私人经营的约翰-汉考克儿童保育中心于1990年开业，其中包括一个种植密集的内部花园。

The 1980s saw similar work being undertaken in a range of other institutions. However, although many plant-filled hotels emerged in that period, little was published about the role and impact of plantscapes in buildings serving the hospitality business. One exception was a short piece penned in 1992 by Michael R. Evans, the former Associate Professor of Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Management at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Evans provided a case study of the Opryland Hotel in Nashville, Tennessee, suggesting that the investment in indoor planting made over several years had proven financially successful. 43 Following the precedent set by John Portman's Hyatt hotel chain, the Opryland Hotel opened in 1977 as the twelfth-biggest hotel in the United States. The research maintained that the hotel's plantscaping encouraged guests to return and resulted in an occupancy rate well over the national average. By 1983 the hotel's earliest plantscaping scheme, the first of three indoor gardens, was in place. It contains a two-acre conservatory resembling iron-and-glass examples from the Victorian era, which features a decorative, 72-foot-high 'Crystal Gazebo' fountain at its centre, as well as walkways on which guests can immerse themselves in lush foliage and a semi-tropical ambiance. Most of the plants were acquired from a Florida nursery in 1982, many of them grown especially for the hotel. Five years later, the one-and- a-half-acre Cascades Atrium was constructed. As well as including large numbers of plants and flowers, it also contains a waterfall, a koi pond and a fountain. A little later, the area known as the Delta Atrium was added (fig. 108), featuring an indoor river along which guests can take a boat ride, and a wide range of subtropical trees and plants, including magnolias, gardenias and camellias. By 1992 the hotel's twelve acres of indoor space contained about 18,000 plants representing around 600 species, including fig trees, banana trees and a small number of miniature orange trees. By 2011 there were sixty-three varieties of palm, among them a 70-foot-tall sugar Palm that the horticulture manager of the hotel, Hollis Malone, had acquired from a collector in Miami in 1986.44 The annual horticulture maintenance budget was about 1.2 million dollars, and a staff of fifty-two was needed to tend the plants. is A drip irrigation system was installed, and plantscaping Was used to justify higher prices for the rooms that overlooked the atrium.

20世纪80年代，一系列其他机构也在进行类似的工作。然而，尽管在此期间出现了许多充满植物的酒店，但很少有关于植物景观在服务于酒店业的建筑中的作用和影响的文章发表。一个例外是迈克尔-R-埃文斯在1992年写的一篇短文，他是弗吉尼亚理工学院和州立大学的前酒店、餐厅和机构管理副教授。埃文斯提供了田纳西州纳什维尔的奥普里兰酒店的案例研究，表明几年来对室内种植的投资已被证明在财务上很成功。43 遵循约翰-波特曼的凯悦连锁酒店的先例，奥普里兰酒店于1977年开业，成为美国第十二大酒店。研究认为，酒店的植物景观鼓励客人再次光临，使入住率远远超过全国平均水平。到1983年，酒店最早的植物景观计划，即三个室内花园中的第一个，已经到位。它包括一个占地两英亩的温室，类似于维多利亚时代的铁和玻璃的例子，它的中心有一个装饰性的72英尺高的 "水晶凉亭 "喷泉，以及走道，客人可以沉浸在茂盛的树叶和半热带的氛围中。大多数植物是1982年从佛罗里达州的一个苗圃获得的，其中许多是专门为该酒店种植的。5年后，占地1.5英亩的Cascades中庭建成了。除了包括大量的植物和花卉之外，它还包括一个瀑布、一个锦鲤池和一个喷泉。稍后，又增加了被称为三角洲中庭的区域（图108），其中有一条室内河流，客人可以乘船沿河而下，还有各种亚热带树木和植物，包括木兰花、栀子花和山茶花。到1992年，酒店12英亩的室内空间有大约18,000种植物，代表大约600个品种，包括无花果树、香蕉树和少量的微型橙树。到2011年，有63个品种的棕榈树，其中有一棵70英尺高的糖棕榈，是酒店的园艺经理霍利斯-马龙于1986年从迈阿密的一位收藏家那里获得的。 44每年的园艺维护预算约为120万美元，需要52名员工来照顾这些植物。 安装了一个滴灌系统，植物景观被用来证明俯瞰中庭的房间价格更高。

Research relating to plants in indoor retail environments came a little later. In 2016 the researchers Sigal Tifferet and Iris Vilhai-lavetz used evolutionary theory, once again, to assess the effects on shoppers of placing a plant in a retail environment, as opposed to having a vase or nothing at all in the same space.16 The authors concluded that 'the plant was superior to both no stimulus and the vase in increasing perceived service quality and customer satisfaction! 47

与室内零售环境中的植物有关的研究来得稍晚。2016年，研究人员Sigal Tifferet和Iris Vilhai-lavetz再次使用进化论来评估在零售环境中摆放植物对购物者的影响，而不是在同一空间摆放花瓶或什么都没有。47

Complementing work on the effects of indoor plants on human beings' health and well-being, the role of indoor plants in tackling air pollution was also widely addressed from the 1970s onwards. The subject came to a head in the wake of a 1989 report by Bill Wolverton, who, by that time, had been a senior research scientist at NASA's Stennis Space Center in Mississippi for eighteen years. Back in 1973, NASA had discovered that Sky Lab 3 had been contaminated by more than 300 volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), and Wolverton had been called in to investigate the problem.

作为对室内植物对人类健康和福祉影响工作的补充，室内植物在解决空气污染方面的作用从20世纪70年代起也被广泛讨论。这个问题在比尔-沃尔弗顿1989年的一份报告中达到了顶峰，当时他已经在密西西比州的美国宇航局斯坦尼斯太空中心担任了18年的高级研究科学家。早在1973年，美国宇航局就发现天空实验室3号已经被300多种挥发性有机物（VOC）污染，沃尔弗顿被要求调查这个问题。

By the early 1980s Wolverton had become renowned for describing plants as 'the lungs of the earth'. He had discovered that certain species - peace lilies, areca palms, lady palms, fig trees and the golden pothos among them - were more effective air purifiers than others. In 1984 he published some of his early research and, three years later, he and his team set out on a two-year project, jointly funded by NASA and the Associated Landscape Contractors of America, to evaluate the ability of twelve common houseplants to remove chemicals from sealed units. Wolverton's 1989 report on the use of interior landscape plants for abating indoor air pollution, based on the above project, was published by NASA. It began by outlining sick building syndrome in general and went on to focus on the air-pollution problems that NASA had identified in sealed space habitats. The main trio of toxins that needed eradication were understood to be benzene, trichloroethvlene and formaldehyde, and the decision to use plants and soil to remove them from the environment seemed obvious to Wolverton. 'Since man's existence on Earth depends upon a life support system involving an intricate relationship with plants and their associated microorganisms', he wrote, 'it should be obvious that when he attempts to isolate himself in tightly sealed buildings away from this ecological system, problems will arise!48 The bulk of the report describes the tests that were performed and the main result, which was that "low-light-requiring houseplants with activated carbon plant filters, have demonstrated the potential for improving indoor air quality by removing trace organic pollutants from the air in energy-efficient buildings! 49

到20世纪80年代初，沃尔弗顿已因将植物描述为 "地球之肺 "而闻名。他发现某些物种--和平百合、棕榈树、女贞子、无花果树和金叶女贞--是比其他物种更有效的空气净化器。1984年，他发表了他的一些早期研究，三年后，他和他的团队开始了一个为期两年的项目，由美国宇航局和美国景观承包商协会共同资助，以评估12种常见的家庭植物从密封单元中清除化学品的能力。沃尔弗顿1989年根据上述项目编写的关于使用室内景观植物减少室内空气污染的报告由NASA出版。报告首先概述了一般的病态建筑综合症，并继续关注美国宇航局在密封的太空栖息地发现的空气污染问题。需要消除的主要三类毒素被认为是苯、三氯乙稀和甲醛，而使用植物和土壤从环境中清除它们的决定对沃尔弗顿来说似乎是显而易见的。他写道："由于人类在地球上的生存依赖于一个生命支持系统，该系统涉及与植物及其相关微生物的复杂关系"，"很明显，当他试图将自己隔离在密闭的建筑物中，远离这个生态系统时，问题就会出现！48 该报告的大部分内容描述了所进行的测试和主要结果，即 "带有活性炭植物过滤器的低光要求的家庭植物，已经证明有可能通过从节能建筑的空气中去除微量有机污染物来改善室内空气质量！49

That simple statement had far-reaching effects. Wolverton retired from NASA in 1990 but was retained as a consultant. His clean-air studies provided the interior landscape industry with a persuasive marketing strategy: they could now sell plants not just as decorative items, but also as a solution to sick building syndrome. In 1996 Wolverton published a popular book that set out to educate the public about the 'so indoor plants that purify the air in homes and offices!se Other researchers in academic institutions as far apart as Sydney, Australia, and Lancashire, England, have carried on the scientific work that Wolverton initiated with NASA.

这一简单的声明产生了深远的影响。沃尔弗顿于1990年从美国宇航局退休，但被聘为顾问。他的清洁空气研究为室内景观行业提供了一个有说服力的营销策略：他们现在不仅可以将植物作为装饰品出售，还可以作为病态建筑综合症的解决方案。1996年，沃尔弗顿出版了一本受欢迎的书，旨在教育公众 "室内植物可以净化家庭和办公室的空气！"其他远在澳大利亚悉尼和英国兰开夏郡的学术机构的研究人员继续进行沃尔弗顿与美国航空航天局发起的科学工作。

After a slight decline in the 1990s, the plantscaping industry bounced back in the 2ooos as the commerclal sector came to understand the proven berterits of indoor plants, and as engaging with them became increasingy fashionable (just as it had in the nineteenth century). The countless studies indicating the positive effects of nature inside on people inhabiting a wide range of spaces impacted on both private individuals and the commercia sector alike. In retail environments there was an obvious effect on profits, and if efficiencies could be achieved in hospitals and prisons, it was reasoned funding could be more effectively deployed.

在经历了20世纪90年代的轻微衰退后，植物景观行业在20世纪90年代出现了反弹。随着商业部门逐渐了解到室内植物经证实的益处，以及与它们打交道的机会越来越多，植物造景业在20世纪90年代出现了回升。的好处，而且与它们打交道也变得越来越时尚。就像在19世纪那样）。无数的研究 无数的研究表明，室内自然对居住在各种空间的人们有积极的影响。众多的研究表明，自然对居住在各种空间的人有积极的影响，对私人和商业部门都有影响。部门都有影响。在零售环境中，对利润有明显的影响。如果在医院和监狱中能够实现效率，就有理由认为 资金可以得到更有效的部署。

The experiments that were undertaken from the 1970s onwards demonstrated that human beings had positive psychological and phvsical responses to indoor plants and that nature was important in maintaining a healthy indoor environment. Victorian advisors on window gardening had known full well that plants could bring happiness to a home, cheer up the sick and lonely, and have a therapeutic effect on invalids. In addition, they had been aware that plants had a physical effect on the indoor environment and its inhabitants, providing air purification, humidification and temperature control. By the twenty-first century the benefits of plants inside were believed to be even more extensive. By absorbing and dulling noise, for example, indoor plants were understood to improve the acoustics in noisy offices or on busy streets.

**从20世纪70年代开始进行的实验表明，人类对室内植物有积极的心理和生理反应，大自然对保持健康的室内环境非常重要。维多利亚时代的窗外园艺顾问清楚地知道，植物可以给家庭带来快乐，使病人和孤独者高兴，并对病人有治疗作用。此外，他们还知道植物对室内环境及其居民有物理影响，提供空气净化、加湿和温度控制。到了21世纪，人们认为室内植物的好处甚至更为广泛。例如，通过吸收和减弱噪音，室内植物被认为可以改善嘈杂办公室或繁忙街道的声学效果。**

Whatever the validity of all these experiments, it is clear that, in the first decades of the twenty-first century, large numbers of people across the world were convinced by them. Nature inside was more popular than ever before, both in people's homes and in public spaces. As a consequence, Conklin and his colleagues were in unprecedented demand. The work undertaken by Wolverton and others in the area of air pollution was just one part of a large body of research that influenced the activities of environmentalists, for whom nature inside held the promise of a new relationship between human beings and the natural world.

无论所有这些实验的有效性如何，很明显的是，在二十一世纪的头几十年里，全世界有大量的人被它们说服了。无论是在人们的家里还是在公共场所，大自然都比以前更受欢迎。因此，康克林和他的同事们受到了前所未有的欢迎。**沃尔弗顿和其他人在空气污染领域开展的工作只是影响环保主义者活动的大量研究的一部分，对他们来说，"室内自然 "是人类和自然界之间新关系的承诺。**

The 1990s promise to be the decade of the environment. 1

1990年代有望成为环境的十年。1

Alongside the research that was being undertaken from the 1970s onwards into the psychological, physical and environmental benefits of indoor plants and flowers, popular awareness was growing about the worrying effects of the long-term imbalance in the relationship between human beings and nature. One of the first calls for a global environmental movement that recognised the damage human beings had caused came in 1962 with the publication, in the United States, of Rachel Carson's environmental science book, Silent Spring. In its introduction, Lord Shackleton described the book's subject as "ecology, or the relation of plants and animals to their environment and to one another'? It had come to Carson's notice that many species were being destroyed by the presence of toxic chemicals in the environment, and she strongly encouraged her readers to become aware of 'The science of ecology [which] teaches us that we have to understand the interaction of all living things in the environment in which we live'3 The book provided an early warning of what happens when human beings start tampering with forests and removing the weeds' upon which insects and animals depend.

从20世纪70年代起，人们开始对室内植物和花卉的心理、生理和环境效益进行研究，与此同时，人们对人类和自然之间的关系长期失衡所产生的令人担忧的影响的认识也在不断提高。1962年，随着雷切尔-卡森的环境科学书《寂静的春天》在美国出版，人们首次呼吁开展全球环境运动，承认人类造成的损害。**在序言中，沙克尔顿勋爵将该书的主题描述为 "生态学，或植物和动物与其环境以及彼此之间的关系"**。卡森注意到，许多物种正在被环境中的有毒化学物质所破坏，她强烈鼓励她的读者了解 "生态学[它]告诉我们，我们必须了解所有生物在我们生活的环境中的相互作用 "3。

Carson's book stimulated the emergence of a popular environmentalist movement, which, by the early 2000s, had come to embrace a broad range of related issues and causes. In 2007 Timothy Morton defined environmentalism as 'a set of cultural and political responses to a crisis of human relationship with their surroundings …[that] could be scientific, activist, or artistic, or a mixture of all three's Arguably, by bringing nature inside both private and public spaces, the interventions that architects, interior designers, plantscapers and home-makers were making into interiors across the globe constituted an aspect of the artistic face of environmentalism. Like all causes, however, environmentalism was open to abuse. **The term 'greenwashing' was coined by septics to describe the exploitative nature of much of the marketing that has been developed around certain goods and services to give commercial companies green credentials. The term greenwashing implies a level of duplicity and, viewed from that perspective, public-sphere green interiors could be seen in the same light. While, on the one hand, they are directly beneficial to human beings on several levels, on the other, they encourage people to work harder and spend more money in order to keep the capitalist economy moving.**

卡森的书刺激了一个**流行的环境主义运动的出现**，到2000年代初，它已经包含了广泛的相关问题和事业。2007年，Timothy Morton将环保主义定义为 "对人类与周围环境关系危机的一系列文化和政治反应......[可能是科学的、积极的或艺术的，或三者的混合。然而，像所有的事业一样，环保主义也有可能被滥用。术语 "**洗绿 "是由septics创造的，用来描述围绕某些商品和服务的营销的剥削性质，以使商业公司具有绿色证书。洗绿 "一词意味着某种程度的欺骗，从这个角度来看，公共场所的绿色室内装饰也可以被视为同样的情况。一方面，它们在多个层面上直接有益于人类，另一方面，它们鼓励人们更努力地工作，花更多的钱，以保持资本主义经济的发展。**

By the early twenty-first century nature inside had acquired a set of new symbolic meanings. Over a period of about a century and a half, a shift had taken place from nature being brought inside as a form of compensation for its separation from human beings as a result of urbanisation, to an almost obsessive inclusion of greenery indoors linked to the environmental crisis of the early 2000s. A tension developed, however, between nature inside signifying a genuine commitment to environmentalism, and its providing a way in which human beings could maintain control over the natural world. While projects such as the Biodome in Montreal, the Eden Project in Cornwall (fig. 109) and, most recently, the restored Temperate House in Kew Gardens (fig. 110) aimed to educate people about plants from around the world and the importance of biodiversity, they also revived the idea of imprisoning plants and flowers under glass in the manner of the colonial glasshouses of the past.

**到21世纪初，室内自然已经获得了一系列新的象征意义。在大约一个半世纪的时间里，发生了一个转变，即从将自然带入室内作为对其因城市化而与人类分离的一种补偿形式，到与21世纪初的环境危机有关的对室内绿色植物近乎痴迷的包容。**然而，**在室内自然标志着对环境主义的真正承诺，以及它提供了一种人类可以保持对自然世界的控制的方式之间，形成了一种紧张关系。虽然诸如蒙特利尔的生物园、康沃尔的伊甸园项目（图109）以及最近修复的邱园温室（图110）等项目旨在教育人们了解世界各地的植物和生物多样性的重要性，但它们也恢复了将植物和花卉囚禁在玻璃下的想法，就像过去殖民时期的玻璃房一样**。

As explained in Chapter 9, in order to persuade the commercial sector to use plants inside, and to support the industries that facilitated the supply and installation of indoor nature, the beneficial effects of plants inside a range of public and semi-public spaces needed to be evidenced. In the popular arena of the home, however, the appeal of nature inside continued to be more emotional than rational. Over a century earlier the authors of advice books had widely recognised that the attraction of indoor nature was almost exclusively to the heart rather than the head." John R. Mollinson had written in 1877 that: 'The love of flowers arouses within us all the kindliest feelings of our nature, humanises the heart, and fills the mind with pleasant thoughts and associations'7 In the commercial context, too, indoor nature could appeal to humans' affective side by helping to create a multisensory experience, as John Portman had recognised by the late 1960s.° Alongside the effects of lighting and colour in nineteenth-century interior décor plants had added a softening element, texture, scents and a sense of exoticism and luxury, and, as Shirley Hibberd had recognised, offered 'rest, solace and refreshment!° Indoor greenery also evoked the hot and humid atmosphere of the jungle. Over a century later, Morton suggested that a sensorial relationship with the natural world was still possible, claiming that 'Nature compels feelings and beliefs! 10

正如第九章所解释的那样，为了说服商业部门在室内使用植物，并支持促进室内自然环境供应和安装的行业，需要证明植物在一系列公共和半公共空间内的有益效果。然而，在流行的家庭领域，室内自然的吸引力仍然是感性而非理性的。一个多世纪以前，建议书的作者们普遍认识到，室内自然的吸引力几乎完全来自于内心而非头脑。**约翰-R-莫林森在1877年曾写道。在商业背景下，室内自然也可以通过帮助创造一种多感官的体验来吸引人类的情感，正如约翰-波特曼在20世纪60年代末所认识到的。** 在十九世纪的室内装饰中，除了灯光和色彩的影响，植物还增加了软化元素、质地、气味以及异国情调和奢华感，而且，正如Shirley Hibberd所认识到的，提供了 "休息、慰藉和提神"° 室内绿色植物也唤起了丛林的炎热和潮湿气氛。**一个多世纪后，莫顿提出，与自然界的感官关系仍然是可能的，他声称 "自然迫使人们产生感情和信仰！"。10**

p184

That emotional relationship with plants and flowers came to the fore in the 1970s British domestic interior. Like the Victorians before them, many urban and suburban residents brought plants and flowers inside as part of a general trend in interior decoration that looked back to a set of idealised and romanticised values linked to life in the pre-industrial era. The actions of professional and amateur home-makers were driven both by a renewed fear of losing humankind's connection with the natural world and with its pre-industrial, pre-urban roots, and by a new realisation that human beings' long-term exploitation of nature was resulting in serious environmental problems. One response to those circumstances was widespread nostalgia While some of the same impulses that had been expressed in the Victorian era resurfaced, from the 1970s onwards they existed within a dramatically transformed context that had seen the rise of - and growing disillusionment with - architectural modernism, unprecedented advances in technology, the emergence of a fully formed global economy and system of communications, and an acute awareness of environmental issues. 11

这种与植物和花卉的情感关系在20世纪70年代的英国家庭室内装饰中凸显出来。像之前的维多利亚时代一样，许多城市和郊区的居民将植物和花卉带入室内，作为室内装饰总趋势的一部分，回顾了与前工业时代的生活相关的一系列理想化和浪漫化的价值观。专业和业余家庭制造者的行动，既是出于对失去人类与自然世界及其前工业、前城市根源的重新恐惧，也是出于对人类长期利用自然导致严重环境问题的新认识。对这些情况的一个反应是普遍的怀旧情绪 虽然一些在维多利亚时代表达的相同冲动再次出现，但从1970年代起，它们存在于一个急剧变化的背景中，这个背景见证了建筑现代主义的兴起和日益幻灭，技术的空前进步，完全形成的全球经济和通信系统的出现，以及对环境问题的强烈意识。11

In 1970s Britain that sense of nostalgia was partly manifested in a revival of interest in the historical English country house and its interior décor. Efforts were made to replicate both its spirit and its aesthetic in contemporary urban and suburban middle-class homes. The exhibition Destruction of the Country House, 1875-1975, held in London's Victoria and Albert Museum in 1974, stimulated that trend. In addition to linking people to an eighteenth- and nineteenth-century past in which ideals of Britishness and the empire were still intact, the return to this domestic style also offered a vision of a simple life free from the complications of advanced technology, and provided domestic comfort and a sense of belonging.

在20世纪70年代的英国，这种怀旧感部分地体现在对历史上的英国乡村住宅及其室内装饰的兴趣的复苏上。人们努力在当代城市和郊区的中产阶级住宅中复制其精神和美学。1974年在伦敦维多利亚和阿尔伯特博物馆举办的 "乡村别墅的毁灭，1875-1975 "展览刺激了这种趋势。除了将人们与十八和十九世纪的过去联系起来，其中英国人和帝国的理想仍然完好无损，对这种家庭风格的回归也提供了一种摆脱先进技术复杂性的简单生活的愿景，并提供了家庭舒适和归属感。

Through the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s this new nostalgic language of interior decoration took hold in popular middle-class urban and suburban settings. Emulating the interiors of the eighteenth-century nobility, it was characterised materially by festooned curtains, chandeliers, comfy sofas, bookshelves, muted colours, antique furniture, chintz, and decorative use of plants and flowers. In 1977 the advice-book writer Ann Bonar explained that: Hanging and climbing plants, such as ivies, rhoicissus and tradescantia can be used as room dividers or put on bookshelves, or placed in troughs on the floor and trained to climb up canes to the ceiling. You can train cissus and philodendron as living decorations round mirrors or up and along window frames.12

在20世纪70年代、80年代和90年代，这种新的怀旧的室内装饰语言在流行的中产阶级城市和郊区环境中占据了主导地位。模仿十八世纪贵族的室内装饰，它在物质上的特点是花纹窗帘、吊灯、舒适的沙发、书架、柔和的色彩、古董家具、绒布，以及植物和鲜花的装饰性使用。1977年，建议书作家安-波纳解释说。悬挂和攀爬的植物，如常春藤、水仙和三角梅，可以用作房间的隔断，或放在书架上，或放在地板上的槽中，训练它们沿着藤条爬到天花板上。你可以将水仙和蝴蝶兰作为活的装饰品放在镜子周围，或沿着窗框向上培养。

The taste for neo-Victorianism of those years is perhaps epitomised in her statement: 'Aspidistras have come into their own again.!'13 Domestic bathrooms were filled with plants in hanging macramé baskets, resembling those that had held orchids in the nineteenth century. The Swiss cheese plant also featured strongly once again. Bonar described its aesthetic contribution: Originally from tropical monsoon forests, it has really large leaves, deeply slashed at the edges. It also has holes in its leaves. When the lights shine through these and cast shadows on to a white wall, the combination of silhouette and the plant itself is extremely effective. 14

她说："Aspidistras又出现了！"13家庭浴室里挂满了植物，就像十九世纪的兰花一样，挂在藤条篮子里。瑞士奶酪植物也再次发挥了重要作用。博纳描述了它的美学贡献。它来自热带季风森林，有非常大的叶子，边缘有深深的裂痕。它的叶子上也有孔。当灯光透过这些孔，将阴影投射到白墙上时，剪影和植物本身的结合是非常有效的。14

Ferns and palms also regained popularity, as did rubber plants and weeping figs. 15 That nostalgic trend remained visible up to the turn of the century, and a 1995 publication entitled Essential English Country Style, written by Yvonne Rees (fig. 111), depicted a simple lifestyle expressed through pine dressers, rocking chairs, blue-and-white china, pewter plates, and traditional kitchen items, such as brown ceramic jelly moulds. The dominant characteristic of that simple life was its appeal to the senses, evoked, for example, by the smells of 'sweet woodsmoke, a rose and lavender-based pot pourri, heady beeswax polish, newly-mown grass and a damp spaniel!"* Bouquets of country flowers, combined with greenery and roughly displayed in rustic pots, were part of that sensorial mix.

蕨类植物和棕榈树也重新受到欢迎，橡胶植物和垂枝无花果也一样。15 这种怀旧的趋势一直到世纪之交都很明显，1995年由伊冯娜-里斯（Yvonne Rees）撰写的一本名为《基本英国乡村风格》的出版物（图111）描绘了一种简单的生活方式，通过松木梳妆台、摇椅、蓝白瓷器、锡制盘子和传统厨房用品（如棕色陶瓷果冻模具）来表达。这种简单生活的主要特点是它对感官的吸引力，例如，由 "甜美的木头烟、以玫瑰和薰衣草为基础的盆栽、令人陶醉的蜂蜡抛光剂、新割的草和潮湿的猎犬 "*的气味所唤起。

Victorian-stvle domestic conservatories also made a reappearance Descriptions of them focused on their atmospheric qualities and their appeal to the senses. Mary Gilliatt wrote evocatively that, for her, 'The warm, damp smell of these graceful glass constructions has always been a heady one."7 Because the advice books of the era were intended to appeal to home-makers, rather than corporate-finance decision-makers, the language used by Gilliatt and her advice book peers differed dramatically from that adopted by the environmental psychologists who were trying to prove the effects of plants and flowers on human beings by scientific means. The 1980s saw similar advice books emerge in France, Sweden, Ireland and the United States, among other countries, suggesting that Britain was not alone in its promotion of an interior decorating style that reflected a nostalgic longing for a past era. Like their nineteenth-century antecedents, the books constituted an industry in themselves, one that built on growing popular disillusionment with the idea of a future that was rooted solely in the promise of new technology.

维多利亚时代的家用温室也重新出现了，对它们的描述集中在它们的大气品质和对感官的吸引力上。玛丽-吉利亚特令人回味的写道，对她来说，"这些优雅的玻璃建筑的温暖、潮湿的气味一直是令人陶醉的。"7 由于这个时代的建议书旨在吸引家庭制造者，而不是公司财务决策者，吉利亚特和她的建议书同行所使用的语言与环境心理学家所采用的语言大相径庭，后者正试图通过科学手段证明植物和花卉对人类的影响。20世纪80年代，法国、瑞典、爱尔兰和美国等国家都出现了类似的建议书，这表明英国并不是唯一在推广一种反映对过去时代的怀旧渴望的室内装饰风格的。就像他们19世纪的前辈一样，这些书本身就构成了一个产业，一个建立在日益增长的大众对未来的幻想上的产业，而这种幻想仅仅植根于新技术的承诺中。

By the dawn of the twenty-first century, the nostalgia for nineteenth-century domestic styles had largely been replaced by an infatuation with what has come to be called 'mid-century modernism', the popular domestic interior decorating idiom of the 1950s, which, as was shown in Chapter 6, had also warmly embraced nature inside. This was a different kind of nostalgia, a retro-futurism that embraced a past vision of the future rather than a past vision of the past.

到了21世纪初，对19世纪家庭风格的怀旧在很大程度上被对所谓的 "世纪中叶现代主义 "的迷恋所取代，50年代流行的家庭室内装饰成语，正如第6章所示，也在内部热烈地拥抱了自然。这是一种不同的怀旧，一种复古的未来主义，拥抱过去对未来的看法，而不是对过去的看法。

By the early twenty-first century, plants (rather more than flowers) had also become part of a global late-modern movement in residential architecture that revived several strategies tried and tested in the first phase of inter-war, and immediate post-war, international modernism. In crowded cities around the world, a lack of outside spaces around houses and apartments drove people to bring nature inside once again. The populations of several Asian countries maintain long-standing relationships with nature through their allegiances to a variety of religious philosophies: Shintoism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Confucianism and others. Those relationships are complex and variable, however, and are often linked to specific locations and cultures. According to Ole Bruun and Arne Kalland, for example, 'Whereas sandal trees have been regarded as sacred and inhabited by spirits on Java and to a lesser extent on Sumba until recently, there exists no indication that people on Timor ever held such beliefs.!'18 The same authors also made the more general point that: 'The nature-culture distinction may be less categorical in the East than in the West and [that] the Japanese do not distinguish sharply between nature and culture. '19

到21世纪初，植物（而不是鲜花）也成为全球住宅建筑晚期现代运动的一部分，它恢复了战时和战后国际现代主义第一阶段尝试和测试的若干策略。在世界各地拥挤的城市中，房屋和公寓周围缺乏外部空间，促使人们再次将自然带入室内。一些亚洲国家的居民通过对各种宗教哲学的忠诚，与自然保持着长期的关系。神道教、佛教、印度教、道教、儒教和其他。然而，这些关系是复杂而多变的，而且往往与特定的地点和文化有关。例如，Ole Bruun和Arne Kalland认为，"在爪哇岛和松巴岛，直到最近，檀香树一直被认为是神圣的，并有神灵居住，但没有迹象表明帝汶岛的人们曾经拥有这样的信仰！"18 同一作者还提出了更普遍的观点。自然与文化的区别在东方可能没有西方那么明确，而且日本人对自然和文化的区别并不明显。'19

Added to the fact that, by the twenty-first century, Japan was a country in which urban space was at a premium, and external gardens and direct sunlight were considered luxuries, this historical closeness between nature and culture may have prompted the numerous progressive Japanese architects who adopted a globalised late-modern idiom that embraced plants inside. As well as reworking indigenous traditions, Japanese architects and designers integrated Western ideas into their buildings, especially those linked to modernism, and introduced plants inside as a means of softening and humanising their indoor spaces. In 2005 Ryue Nishizawa of Studio SANAA designed a house for Yasuo Moriyama in Tokyo. It comprised a number of variously sized cubes, the spaces both within and between the cubes containing numerous plants (fig. 112). In 2009 the architectural group Suppose Design, which is based in Tokyo and Hiroshima, designed a house in Nagoya that featured an indoor garden. z An architectural critic described Suppose Design's spaces as 'otherworldly ... almost how one might imagine a greenhouse within a space ship, designed to keep the passengers healthy, happy and sane!"' UID Architects also placed a tree inside a house, called Shrimp, which was built in Fukuyama in 2014. As it had decades earlier in Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Villa Tugendhat (1929-30), indoor vegetation in these Japanese houses served to provide a counterpoint to their otherwise hard, geometric architectural structures and industrial materials. They also brought nature into the city.

再加上到了21世纪，**日本是一个城市空间非常宝贵的国家，外部花园和阳光直射被认为是奢侈品，这种自然和文化之间的历史密切关系可能促使众多进步的日本建筑师采用全球化的晚期现代成语，在室内拥抱植物。除了重塑本土传统，日本建筑师和设计师还将西方思想融入他们的建筑，特别是那些与现代主义有关的建筑，并将植物引入室内，作为软化和人性化室内空间的一种手段。2005年，SANAA工作室的Ryue Nishizawa在东京为Yasuo Moriyama设计了一座房子。**它由许多不同大小的立方体组成，立方体内部和之间的空间都有许多植物（图112）。2009年，总部位于东京和广岛的建筑团体Suppose Design在名古屋设计了一栋以室内花园为特色的房子。 z 一位建筑评论家将Suppose Design的空间描述为 "超凡脱俗......几乎可以想象到太空船内的温室，旨在保持乘客的健康、快乐和理智！UID建筑事务所还在一栋名为 "虾 "的房子里放置了一棵树，该房子于2014年在福山建成。**正如几十年前路德维希-密斯-凡-德-罗的图根哈特别墅（1929-30）一样，这些日本房屋中的室内植被为其原本坚硬的几何建筑结构和工业材料提供了一种反衬。他们还将自然带入城市。**

Architects and designers working in a range of other Asian countries also filled their indoor spaces with plants. In a 2018 house designed by Aaksen Responsible Architecture in Bandung, Indonesia, a Brazilian fire -tree pierced the white zine- coated roof of the building from within. Branches protruded Through circular openings cut into the decks of a house designed by Buco pradono in Jakarta (201 5), while trees emerged through openings in the rass-covered roof of another of that studio's projects in the city of Depok (2011). Chang Architects' 2005 Elok House in Singapore also contained trees, which wound their way through its internal spaces and created a cool microclimate.?? Although not residential, the G-Tower in Incheon, south Korea, designed in 2013 by HAEAHN and containing restaurants, banks and a post office, features an indoor garden (fig. 113).

在一系列其他亚洲国家工作的建筑师和设计师也用植物填充他们的室内空间。在Aaksen Responsible Architecture于2018年在印度尼西亚万隆设计的房屋中，一棵巴西火树从内部刺穿了建筑的白色zine涂层屋顶。树枝从Buco pradono在雅加达设计的房子的圆形开口处伸出来（2015年），而树木则从该工作室在德波克市的另一个项目（2011年）的草皮覆盖的屋顶上的开口处冒出来。张建筑师事务所2005年在新加坡设计的Elok House也包含了树木，它们在其内部空间中蜿蜒而行，创造了一个凉爽的小气候。虽然不是住宅，但2013年由HAEAHN设计的位于韩国仁川的G-Tower，包含了餐厅、银行和邮局，有一个室内花园（图113）。

Demonstrating the global reach of indoor nature in domestic settings in the early twenty-first century, similar strategies were also implemented on the American continent. In Mexico, for example, a forest of sweet gum trees emerged through openings in the concrete slabs of the julio Hernández House in Morelia, designed in 2016 by Roof Arquitectos, while in 2017 the architect David Guerra created a house in south-eastern Brazil that he filled with tropical palm trees and colourful plants.23 The desire to include nature inside in those locations could be explained by the fact that Asia and Central/South America were late adopters of the Western model of architectural modernism. However, seen from a less Western-centric perspective, they could also be seen to be reasserting an aspect of their own local cultures, that is, a closer alignment between nature and culture than existed in the West. Also, as many of the exotic plants used in the West from the eighteenth century onwards had originated in Asia and the Americas, local architects and designers had easy access to them. Most of the plants used by American plantscapers in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries were imported from Mexico, Costa Rica and Colombia, and the expansion of their work encouraged the growth of large global businesses in those countries.

在二十一世纪初，类似的策略在美洲大陆也得到了实施，显示了室内自然在家庭环境中的全球影响力。例如，在墨西哥，由Roof Arquitectos于2016年设计的莫雷利亚的julio Hernández住宅的混凝土板上出现了一片甜胶树森林，而在2017年，建筑师David Guerra在巴西东南部创造了一座房子，他用热带棕榈树和彩色植物填充。然而，从一个不那么以西方为中心的角度来看，他们也可以被看作是在重申他们自己当地文化的一个方面，也就是说，自然和文化之间的结合比西方存在的更紧密。另外，由于十八世纪以来西方使用的许多外来植物都源自亚洲和美洲，当地的建筑师和设计师可以很容易地获得它们。二十世纪末和二十一世纪初，美国植物学家使用的大多数植物都是从墨西哥、哥斯达黎加和哥伦比亚进口的，他们工作的扩大鼓励了这些国家的大型全球企业的发展。

A number of residential apartment blocks in several urban centres across the globe were also given the green treatment. In Europe, Milan's Bosco Verticale ('Vertical Forest"', fig. 114), a pair of towers designed by Boeri Studio and constructed over the period 2009-14, features large balconies that host full-size trees, shrubs and ground cover, giving the exterior of the building a wooded appearance. While there are practical benefits, such as noise abatement and a means of dealing with smog, the main effect of the towers on Milan's skyline is aesthetic. Boer applied the same principle in his proposal for the Trudo Vertical Forest social-housing project in Eindhoven in the Netherlands. Across the Atlantic, in Toronto, a similar tower has been proposed by the architectural firm Penda.24 

全球多个城市中心的一些住宅公寓楼也得到了绿色处理。在欧洲，米兰的Bosco Verticale（"垂直森林"，图114）是由Boeri工作室设计的一对塔楼，在2009-14年期间建造，其特点是大阳台上有全尺寸的树木、灌木和地被，使建筑的外部看起来像森林。虽然有一些实际的好处，如减少噪音和处理烟雾的手段，但这些塔楼对米兰天际线的主要影响是审美。博尔在他对荷兰埃因霍温的特鲁多垂直森林社会住房项目的建议中也应用了同样的原则。在大西洋彼岸的多伦多，彭达建筑事务所也提出了类似的塔楼。

While, in the years after 1990, plants and flowers featured widely in the interior décor of many private homes across the world- both nostalgic and contemporary - the same period saw plants and flowers continuing to penetrate global public and semi-public buildings. Countless immersive, Jungle-like public atmospheres were created, which facilitated the possiblity of escape from the stresses of city life, encouraged an engagement with commerce, provided added value for the owners of the buildings in question, and, depending on local legislation, could allow developers to construct larger buildings than would otherwise have been possible. In the form of enclosed trees, indoor gardens, carefully positioned individual plants and groups of plants, living walls, or a combination of several of those plantscaping strategies, nature infiltrated scores of offices, large hotels, corporate buildings, railway stations and airports, shopping malls, retail outlets and other commercial spaces, well-being and ecology centres, and cultural institutions. Although tactics used by the inter-war and post-war twentieth-century modernists were often revived, the scale was augmented significantly and nature inside took on new meanings.

1990年后，植物和花卉广泛出现在世界各地许多私人住宅的室内装饰中--包括怀旧和现代--同一时期，植物和花卉继续渗透到全球公共和半公共建筑中。无数沉浸式的、像丛林一样的公共氛围被创造出来，这为逃避城市生活的压力提供了可能，鼓励了对商业的参与，为相关建筑的所有者提供了附加值，并且根据当地的立法，可以允许开发商建造比原来更大的建筑。通过封闭的树木、室内花园、精心布置的单个植物和植物群、活墙，或这些植物景观策略的组合，自然渗透到了许多办公室、大型酒店、公司大楼、火车站和机场、购物中心、零售店和其他商业空间、健康和生态中心以及文化机构。尽管战时和战后的二十世纪现代主义者所使用的策略经常被恢复，但其规模被大大增加，内部的自然也有了新的含义。

The agendas underpinning the decisions to introduce nature into those large public interior spaces ranged from a genuine attempt to improve people's lives to unapologetic commercial exploitation. At both ends of the spectrum, plants' functional qualities - their capacity for air cleansing and oxygenation, and their links to well-being - were used to justify their presence. However, for the majority of the population who experienced indoor plants, it was undoubtedly their emotional, sensorial, aesthetic and atmospheric effects that were most important.

将自然引入这些大型公共室内空间的决定所依据的议程，从改善人们生活的真正尝试到毫不掩饰的商业开发。在光谱的两端，植物的功能品质--它们净化空气和充氧的能力，以及它们与健康的联系--被用来证明它们的存在。然而，对于大多数体验过室内植物的人来说，最重要的无疑是它们的情感、感觉、审美和氛围效果。

As they had in the late nineteenth century, plants and flowers transferred domestic values into the public arena such that the boundaries between the private and public spheres became increasingly porous. As an adjunct to new architectural typologies and interior design strategies that fostered ambiguous spaces, the inclusion of nature in urban indoor settings provided an important way of encouraging seamless living. While new personal communications and information technologies permitted previously limited activities to be undertaken in a wide variety of environments - laptops and mobile phones, for example, are extensively used in coffee shops, book shops and airport lounges, among many other places - indoor planting schemes reinforced that newfound flexibility and freedom.

正如他们在19世纪末所做的那样，植物和花卉将家庭价值转移到公共领域，从而使私人和公共领域之间的界限变得越来越松散。作为新的建筑类型和室内设计策略的补充，促进了模糊的空间，将自然纳入城市室内环境提供了鼓励无缝生活的重要方式。新的个人通信和信息技术允许在各种各样的环境中进行以前有限的活动--例如，笔记本电脑和移动电话在咖啡馆、书店和机场休息室等许多地方被广泛使用--室内种植计划加强了这种新发现的灵活性和自由。

The familiar strategy of either leaving trees on site, or bringing them inside, which had characterised buildings by Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier and had featured in New York's Four Seasons Restaurant in earlier decades, re-emerged after 1970 on a significant scale. Palm trees were, as ever, particularly popular. César Pelli's atrium at New York's Battery Park in the World Financial Center (1988) was among the first large urban interior public spaces, and one of the most spectacular, to feature palm trees (fig. 115). It contained a grove of sixteen thread palms, each 45 feet tall, which had been transported to New York from California. As Martin Gottlieb explained in the New York Times, that particular species was "chosen for its monumental quality, lushness and elegant trunk'25 Ten storeys high, the atrium was designed by Pelli in collaboration with his wife, the landscape designer and environmentalist Diana Balmori, who created the winter garden. The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 seriously damaged the site, but the original 1988 space was reconstructed in the following year. Although linked to the Financial Center, the space is dedicated to culture, hosting concerts, ballets and art exhibitions. The drama of the towering palm trees reinforces the immersive and emotive capacity of nature inside, as well as animating the otherwise static, late-modern steel-and-glass architecture that encases them. Some years after the atrium opened, the original palms grew too tall for the space and had to be replaced with smaller ones.

熟悉的策略是，要么把树留在现场，要么把它们带入室内，这曾是弗兰克-劳埃德-赖特和勒-柯布西耶的建筑的特点，也曾在早几十年的纽约四季餐厅中出现过，1970年后，这种策略又大规模地出现了。棕榈树和以往一样，特别受欢迎。凯撒-佩利在纽约世界金融中心的炮台公园的中庭（1988年）是第一批以棕榈树为特色的大型城市室内公共空间之一，也是最壮观的一个（图115）。它包含一个由16棵线状棕榈树组成的小树林，每棵树都有45英尺高，从加利福尼亚运到纽约。正如马丁-戈特利布在《纽约时报》上所解释的那样，这种特殊的树种 "因其不朽的品质、茂盛的生命力和优雅的树干而被选中 "25。 中庭有十层楼高，由佩利与他的妻子、景观设计师和环境学家戴安娜-巴尔莫里合作设计，后者创造了冬季花园。2001年9月11日的恐怖袭击严重破坏了该场地，但1988年的原始空间在第二年得到了重建。虽然与金融中心相连，但该空间致力于文化，举办音乐会、芭蕾舞和艺术展览。高耸的棕榈树的戏剧性加强了自然界内部的沉浸感和情感能力，同时也使包裹着它们的原本静态的晚期现代钢铁和玻璃建筑变得生动。在中庭开放几年后，原来的棕榈树对空间来说太高了，不得不用较小的棕榈树代替。

In Europe, the vast glass dome of Basel-Mulhouse Airport's Skyview Lounge (2005) also covers a number of exotic palms and a calming pool of water, introduced to alleviate the stress of the anxious travellers who pass time there.26 The Knockbreda health centre in Belfast (2008) also features a palm tree in its central, naturally lit atrium. The aim is to provide a life-affirming and soothing waiting area for patients. Other trees were also brought into buildings to great effect in the first decades of the twenty-first century. As mentioned in the Introduction, in 2011 the wedding of Prince William to Catherine Middleton in Westminster Abbey, London, was enhanced by the addition of four tons of foliage. The aim was to recreate a lavish English country garden'27 It was an example of pure theatre, choreographed by the event's "floral artistic director', Shane Connolly.28

在欧洲，巴塞尔-穆尔豪斯机场的Skyview Lounge（2005年）的巨大玻璃穹顶也覆盖了一些异国情调的棕榈树和一个平静的水池，是为了缓解在那里打发时间的焦虑的旅客的压力。26 贝尔法斯特的Knockbreda健康中心（2008年）也在其自然采光的中央中庭里种植了棕榈树。其目的是为病人提供一个充满生机和舒缓的等待区。在二十一世纪的前几十年，其他树木也被带入建筑中，取得了巨大的效果。正如导言中提到的，2011年威廉王子与凯瑟琳-米德尔顿在伦敦威斯敏斯特教堂的婚礼上，增加了四吨的树叶，使婚礼更加精彩。其目的是重现一个奢华的英国乡村花园。27 这是一个纯粹的戏剧性的例子，由该活动的 "花艺总监 "Shane Connolly编排的。

Norman Foster + Partners have introduced trees into several Apple stores across the globe (fig. 116). The Singapore store, opened in 2017, was built on Apple Orchard Road, a former site of fruit and nutmeg orchards, which inspired the store's green theme. Singapore's status as the greenest place in Asia also influenced the design. Eight mature trees create a shaded 'green orchard' outside, while, inside, twelve weeping fig trees form what Apple calls its 'Genius Grove', a replacement for the 'Genius Bars' of earlier stores. It was included, the Foster office claimed, not only for the strong visual aesthetic but also to 'stimulate all human senses - enriching the temperature, the smell, and the aural qualities of the space. It creates an oasis of tranquillity in the busiest part of the store'29 The doughnut-shaped planters double as seats for customers.

Norman Foster + Partners将树木引入了全球的几家苹果商店（图116）。2017年开业的新加坡店建在苹果乌节路，这里曾是水果和肉豆蔻果园的所在地，这激发了该店的绿色主题。新加坡作为亚洲最绿的地方的地位也影响了设计。八棵成熟的树木在外面形成了一个遮荫的 "绿色果园"，而在里面，12**棵垂枝无花果树形成了苹果公司所谓的 "天才林"，取代了早期商店的 "天才吧"。福斯特办公室声称，将其包括在内，不仅是为了强烈的视觉美感，也是为了 "刺激人类的所有感官--丰富空间的温度、气味和听觉质量。**它在商店最繁忙的地方创造了一片宁静的绿洲。29 甜甜圈形状的花盆可以作为顾客的座位。

In addition to the dramatic inclusion of full-size trees in indoor settings, many of the most powerful and memorable plantscapes that appeared in the decades around the turn of the century were large indoor gardens. Madrid's Atocha railway station, which was reconstructed in 1992, contains a full-scale botanical garden and turtle sanctuary. Over 7,000 plants and trees, representing over 260 species, cover an area of 13,000 feet. A swamp, filled with Malabar chestnut trees, occupies one end. Foster + Partners' Crossrail terminal in London (2015; fig. 117) and Oslo Central railway station also use large installations of indoor greenery to calm those who pass through them.

除了在室内环境中戏剧性地加入全尺寸的树木外，在世纪之交的几十年中出现的许多最强大和最令人难忘的植物景观都是大型室内花园。马德里的阿托查火车站于1992年重建，包含一个完整的植物园和海龟保护区。超过7000种植物和树木，代表260多个物种，覆盖了13000英尺的面积。一片沼泽地里种满了马拉巴栗子树，占据了一端。Foster + Partners在伦敦的Crossrail航站楼（2015年；图117）和奥斯陆中央火车站也使用了大型的室内绿化装置来安抚那些通过它们的人。

The planting that the landscape architectural practice Gillespies developed for London's Sky Garden, a commercial space that opened in 2015, was dominated by drought-resistant Mediterranean and African species (fig. 118).3° Aimed at a general audience, Sky Garden is a leisure space at the top of a commercial skyscraper located at 20 Fenchurch Street, to which the public is invited (albeit with a number of restrictions) to eat, drink, wander around, take photographs and generally enjoy themselves. Visitors are wooed there by the spectacle of the planting, lulled into relaxation by the soothing green surroundings, and then invited to spend money at the venue's many eateries. The Sky Garden recalls the leisure spaces of the nineteenth century - the Crystal Palace, the Royal Aquarium and Summer and Winter Gardens, and the Alexandra Palace among them - which used indoor plants to encourage leisured consumption. The Fenchurch Street building has the extra advantage of a captive audience in the people who work in it. As the architectural critic Rowan Moore pointed out, however, the Sky Garden is not a park in which children can run around and play. Rather, the reason for its existence, Moore claimed, was that it enabled its developers to gain planning permission,31

景观建筑事务所Gillespies为伦敦的空中花园（2015年开放的一个商业空间）开发的种植，主要是抗旱的地中海和非洲物种（图118）。3°针对普通观众，空中花园是位于芬彻奇街20号的商业摩天大楼顶部的一个休闲空间，公众被邀请（尽管有一些限制）到那里吃饭、喝酒、闲逛、拍照和普遍享受。游客们被壮观的植物所吸引，被舒缓的绿色环境所吸引，进入放松状态，然后被邀请到场内的许多餐厅消费。空中花园让人想起十九世纪的休闲空间--水晶宫、皇家水族馆、夏季和冬季花园，以及亚历山大宫等，它们利用室内植物来鼓励休闲消费。芬彻奇街的建筑有一个额外的优势，那就是在里面工作的人都是忠实的观众。然而，正如建筑评论家Rowan Moore所指出的，空中花园并不是一个可以让孩子们到处跑动和玩耍的公园。摩尔称，其存在的原因是，它使其开发商能够获得规划许可，31

In the early years of the twenty-first century plants and flowers were also used on a smaller scale in many other public buildings, airports and malls among them. As well as encouraging shoppers to consume, they acted as directional signs, indicated changes of level, softened hard architecture, and added colour and texture. The designers of the Swedish fashion store & Other Stories, for instance, placed small plants - cacti and succulents -at various points in the store to give its customers a sense of being at home, to provide warmth and colour, and to appeal to its young audience, for whom owning such greenery constituted a grounding lifestyle choice in an age of uncertainty.

在二十一世纪的早期，植物和花卉也被小规模地用于许多其他公共建筑，其中包括机场和商场。除了鼓励购物者消费外，它们还充当了方向标，指示水平的变化，软化了坚硬的建筑，并增加了颜色和质地。例如，瑞典时装店&Other Stories的设计师在店内各处摆放了小型植物--仙人掌和多肉植物，给顾客一种在家的感觉，提供温暖和色彩，并吸引其年轻观众，对他们来说，在这个不确定的时代，拥有这样的绿色植物是一种接地气的生活方式选择。

In its European flagship outlet in London's Regent Street, the American fashion store Anthropologie invested heavily in 2009 in what are interchangeably called green, living or vertical walls, one of the latest forms of indoor planting (fig. 119). The brainchild of a French botanist named Patrick Blanc, who created his first living wall in 1986, they were soon visible on both the exteriors and interiors of buildings. A dramatic exterior example was added to Jean Nouvel's Musée du quai Branly in Paris in 2004.

2009年，美国时装店Anthropologie在其位于伦敦摄政街的欧洲旗舰店中，大量投资于可互换的绿色、活体或垂直墙，这是最新的室内种植形式之一（图119）。法国植物学家帕特里克-布朗于1986年创造了他的第一面活体墙，他的创意很快在建筑的外部和内部都能看到。2004年，让-努维尔（Jean Nouvel）在巴黎的布朗利博物馆（Musée du quai Branly）中增加了一个引人注目的外部例子。

Living walls consist of plants rooted in fibrous material, with the water that hydrates them being reused and/or recirculated. Some are pre-grown, while others are planted on site. They can be found in a variety of usually commercial indoor spaces, particularly corporate offices, such as the Try Insurance headquarters in Copenhagen (constructed over the period 2007-11), an office in Wilson Street, London (2013), and the David Rubenstein Atrium in New York's Lincoln Center (2009). The wall in the Wilson Street office comprises ferns, ivy, peace lilies and begonias, and was designed by Biotecture, the supplier of the wall in the Anthropologie store, and in Oliver Heath's design for the Re:Mind project. a Again with the aim of calming stressed passengers, Gate 25 at Heathrow's Terminal 3 features what it calls a 'Garden Gate', another Biotecture living wall, composed of 1,680 plants including ivy and lilies.33 Airports in Changi, Singapore (fig. 120), Edmonton, Canada, and Christchurch, New Zealand, also feature living walls, as does the Etsy headquarters in Dumbo, Brooklyn, where 11,000 indoor plants were installed in 2016 by Greenery NYC.34 The dramatic installation ensures that every employee can see some of the greenery, which benefits from a state-of-the-art rainwater-harvesting and irrigation system.

活墙由扎根在纤维材料中的植物组成，使其水化的水被重新使用和/或循环。有些是预先种植的，有些则是在现场种植的。它们可以在各种通常的商业室内空间中找到，特别是企业办公室，如哥本哈根的Try Insurance总部（2007-11年期间建造）、伦敦威尔逊街的一间办公室（2013年）和纽约林肯中心的David Rubenstein Atrium（2009年）。威尔逊街办公室的墙由蕨类植物、常春藤、和平百合和秋海棠组成，由Biotecture公司设计，该公司是Anthropologie商店的墙的供应商，也是Oliver Heath为Re:Mind项目设计的供应商。新加坡樟宜机场（图120）、加拿大埃德蒙顿机场和新西兰克赖斯特彻奇机场也设有活体墙，位于布鲁克林Dumbo的Etsy总部也是如此，2016年Greenery NYC公司在这里安装了11000株室内植物。

Two decades into the twenty-first century, the popular enthusiasm for nature inside continues unabated. It appeals to human beings in very complex ways, some of them probably too deeply embedded in the human psyche for us to be able to easily explain them. Nature inside's life- affirming qualities undoubtedly act as a form of compensation for some of the less life-enhancing aspects of contemporary life, for example, the loss of rural life for large sections of the population, an over-dependence on technology, social isolation, and environmental problems. It also provides us with nurturing opportunities and even a form of friendship. It eases tensions, both psychological and spatial.

进入21世纪20年后，人们对大自然的热情有增无减。它以非常复杂的方式吸引着人类，其中一些可能深深地扎根于人类的心理，我们无法轻易解释。内在的自然对生命的肯定无疑是对当代生活中一些不太能促进生命的方面的一种补偿，例如，大部分人口失去了农村生活，对技术的过度依赖，社会隔离和环境问题。它还为我们提供了培养的机会，甚至是一种友谊的形式。它缓解了心理和空间上的紧张。

While these functions of nature inside have remained constant throughout the modern era, it is also clear that indoor plants and flowers have been able to change their symbolic meanings to suit the dominant agendas of the day. While in the Victorian era they took on a strong religious or spiritual dimension, within modernism their spatial properties were exploited to the full. Although by the 196os they had become aligned with a scientific agenda, by the following decade their affective powers had come to be fully appreciated. More recently, they have come to represent all the issues being addressed by environmentalists.

虽然自然界的这些功能在整个现代时代保持不变，但很明显，**室内植物和花卉已经能够改变其象征意义，以适应当时的主导议程。在维多利亚时代，它们具有强烈的宗教或精神维度，而在现代主义时期，它们的空间属性被充分地利用。**尽管到了1960年代，它们已经与科学议程相一致，但到了下一个十年，它们的情感力量已经得到了充分的重视。最近，它们已经开始代表环保主义者正在解决的所有问题。

Whatever functions and meanings nature inside takes on in the future, it is clear that our desire to bring plants and flowers into our indoor spaces is not going away in the short term. Whether in the home, the workplace, the shopping mall, or in the spaces that operate across the private-public divide, by inviting greenery and flowers inside we feel that we are engaging with nature and helping to re-establish a more balanced relationship with it.

无论自然界在未来具有什么样的功能和意义，很明显，我们将植物和鲜花带入室内空间的愿望在短期内不会消失。**无论是在家庭、工作场所、购物中心，还是在跨越私人-公共鸿沟的空间，通过邀请绿色植物和鲜花进入室内，我们感到我们正在与自然接触，并帮助重新建立与自然的更平衡的关系。**
