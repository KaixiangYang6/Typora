1. Inspired by vinyl records. It transforms sound into physical detail, achieved by sculpting Vinyl Records. People listen to vinyl with patience and respect, without frequently switching to the next track. What would natural stuffs sound like, no matter organic or inorganic matters that are inherently rich in physical detail, are played in a similar format. What would it sound like to play a leaf, a piece of granite spinning on the vinyl player.

  

  The probe/needle in the vinyl player is turned into a sensor that can detect RBG. The RGB or Gray value is transmitted to maxmsp  that contains a sound automated algorithm.

  

2. Fingerprints are unique as biometric features representing biological identity. It is not only a picture, but can also be characteristic data in the understanding of the recognition algorithm (number of bifurcation points, orientation, vectors, etc.). Fingerprint images or feature parameters can be transformed into sounds in maxmsp.

   

3. I have 3 hard disk drives totalling 13T and a 12T cloud drive for storing data and I find that I suffer from storage stress anxietyï¼Œ  as well as a distrust of storage. As if more storage space would give me a sense of security, but much of the data I actually produce is redundant junk, like only 1 out of 30 photos worthy of being stored and a lot of videos documenting my life are stored there. I want to record everything I experience.

  

  If the viewer is actually confronted with a mass of storage media, a mass of mechanical hard drives with probes that start moving when every second of what people experience is automatically recorded, does this make people think about what is really valuable, which kind of digital media is important.
