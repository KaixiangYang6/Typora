Week 1 Diary

I expect that I will understand what is being said in seminar. But as soon as the first theory seminar started, I realised that it was a huge challenge. I needed to pay full attention to what the tutor was saying, and the large number of words I didn't know prevented me from understanding, comprehending. Even though I knew all the words the tutor was saying, I was still unable to form a logical structure and summarise or repeat what was said.

So I needed to watch the recorded seminar, consult the words and remember what was said. This often took 1.5 times the length of the original course. Gradually I could understand what the teacher was saying, except for some unfamiliar academic words. One of the things that helped me a lot was Google Live Captioning when I was listening to the lectures.

Although these theories, which I had not been exposed to, were difficult to understand, the process of learning them made me feel painful and excited. The seminar was showing me different perspectives held by different artist, philosophers and the process of learning was kind of like getting closer to the truth of the world. Opening my eyes and giving me more perspectives.



I find it difficult to apply the theories I learnt to specific projects and I struggled to find concrete links between the theory and projects. Perhaps it is because I had quite less theories and it is difficult to construct a theoretical framework suitable for a centain project. Startign off with theories and ending up with a form of media is a tough thing for me, I am always stuck halway.
